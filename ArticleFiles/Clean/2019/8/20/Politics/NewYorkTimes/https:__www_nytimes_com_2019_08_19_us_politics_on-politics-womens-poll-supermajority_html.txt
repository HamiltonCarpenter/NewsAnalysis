But there has been far less focus on what, exactly, all these female voters want.
“Women’s equality is at the forefront of people’s minds in a way that it hasn’t been ever in my history of looking at research and polling,” said Cecile Richards, the former Planned Parenthood president. “How candidates talk about these issues and think about them is really going to be influential in the coming elections.”
Supermajority, a nonpartisan organization, aims to train two million women to organize around political issues related to women’s equality. Part of that effort means asking about topics that are rarely addressed in political surveys — issues including gender equity and recent restrictions on abortion.
Here’s some of what they found.
On gender equality:
• There is a big partisan split over whether gender equality has been achieved: While 88 percent of Democratic women believe there is “still work to be done,” just 46 percent of Republican women agree.
On the recent abortion laws:
• The passage of new abortion laws, which essentially banned the procedure in a number of states, was a mobilizing moment for many female voters. Fifty-five percent of women said the recent laws made them think about the state of women’s rights and equality; 57 percent said they talked to friends or family about them.
On President Trump:
• Nearly every segment of female voters is more likely to think President Trump has made things worse for women, rather than better: Democratic women, 81 percent to 5 percent; Latinx women, 57 to 21; independent women, 47 to 25. Only Republican women disagree — 5 percent said he had made things worse for them, while 62 percent said better.
On the 2020 election:
• The survey asked which issues are “extremely important” in the presidential election. Climate change was an answer for 65 percent of Democratic women, and 14 percent of Republican women. Conversely, illegal immigration was a response for 72 percent of Republicans, and 43 percent of Democrats.
Tresa Undem, who conducted the poll, said she started seeing women take a more assertive position on issues of equality beginning in 2014. Since Mr. Trump’s election, she said, that sentiment has exploded.
“We were observing this simmering. And then we saw it erupt,” she said. “In my view, we are in the midst of a massive women’s movement.”
Katherine Grainger, a co-founder of Supermajority and a partner at Civitas Public Affairs Group, agrees. “What we’re in right now is kind of a crescendo moment where women who normally were on the sidelines are getting involved,” she said. “Women are feeling their power.”

Tonight we have the third installment of our state fair series Candidates on Rides in Iowa, featuring Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
In this edition, Ms. Gillibrand and her son Henry, 11, take the Grand Wheel. Henry is excited. Ms. Gillibrand … maybe a little less so.
Lisa: What’s the best thing you did at the fair so far?
One thing that struck us was how central gun control has become in this primary. Do you think it’s changed the race in some way?
(Looks down from the ride, grimaces) I’m looking up.
So, to answer your question, I don’t think it’s changing the race. But I do think it’s something that people want to talk about, and they want to make sure that you’re going to put their family first. It’s absurd that our kids today have to be doing shelter-in-place drills. When there was a shooting a mile from Henry’s school, they had to shelter in place.
Do you think the Democratic field’s too big? It’s a complaint I’ve heard from a lot of voters.
And I do believe there’s been a false choice in the narrative, that you either have to be a super-uber-progressive who inspires the base or you need to be the moderate who wins back those Obama-Trump voters. I don’t think that’s true. I think you actually need somebody who can do both, which is ultimately why I decided to run, because I can do both, and I have done both in the decade I’ve been in public service and in the U.S. Senate.
I’m wondering if you think that you have taken a disproportionate amount of, uh, (glancing at Henry), poop, for the Al Franken situation? 
I think that, given he had eight allegations — two since he was elected, and the last one was a congressional staffer — I just got to the point where enough was enough, and I wasn’t willing to continue to defend him with my silence and continue to carry his water. And I felt I had to speak out. I was the first, and 34 other senators quickly followed me. You wouldn’t know that today because I seem to stand alone. But we, as a party, should hold each other to the highest standards, not the lowest.
In your view, is there a path back for some people who are accused in this #MeToo era? And what does that look like?
(The ride approaches the end) Oh, that’s it? It’s so short. They need to make money.
Was this the most humiliating thing you’ve done in this presidential race?
We can do that next?
