The remark by Pompeo, who at the time represented Kansas’ 4th Congressional District, sharply contrasts with his lavish praise for Trump after joining the president’s administration.
“You know, Donald Trump the other day said that ‘if he tells a soldier to commit a war crime, the soldier will just go do it,’ ” the video shows Pompeo saying at a March 2016 event in Wichita. “He said, ‘They’ll do as I tell them to do.’ We’ve spent seven-and-a-half years with an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution. We don’t need four more years of that.”
The event took place on the day of the Kansas presidential caucuses, and Pompeo had endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.); after listening to Pompeo’s remarks from backstage, Trump demanded to know who Pompeo was, the New Yorker reported.
In one exchange this year with Fox News Channel’s Chris Wallace, Pompeo dismissed the anchor’s questions about Trump’s position on accepting foreign opposition research as “a Washington piece of silliness.”
In another interview with CBS’s Margaret Brennan, Pompeo bristled when asked about the discrepancy between his own statement that China was holding a million Chinese Muslims in “reeducation camps” and Defense Department figures, which put the number closer to 3 million.
“Don’t play ticky-tack,” Pompeo said. “There’s no discrepancy.”
