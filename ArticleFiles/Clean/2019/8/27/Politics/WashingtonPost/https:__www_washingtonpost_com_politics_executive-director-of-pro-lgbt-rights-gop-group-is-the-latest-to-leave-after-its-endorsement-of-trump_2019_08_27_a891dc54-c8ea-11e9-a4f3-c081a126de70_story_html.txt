The executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a group for conservatives who support gay rights, is the latest person to resign over the organization’s endorsement of President Trump.
Moran did not provide a reason for Henry’s exit, but the Blade reported that she left because of her disapproval of the Trump endorsement.
Henry’s name was not included on the op-ed, suggesting discord in the group’s top ranks.
Kabel and Homan cited Trump’s stated desire to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS in 10 years and his efforts to “end the criminalization of homosexuality” globally as reasons he earned their support. But ­LGBTQ advocates critical of the president point to Trump’s ban on transgender people serving in the military, his Justice Department’s support for allowing employers to fire LGBTQ workers based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and his administration’s termination of a regulation prohibiting doctors from discriminating against transgender patients as evidence that the president is not an ally.
“It seems that the ‘premier Republican organization for LGBTQ+ conservatives’ couldn’t care less about which form of acceptance qualifies as passable allyship and would instead willfully embrace an administration notorious for hollow words, fairweather friends, and a seemingly endless number of cuts for us to endure,” Evans wrote.
Several other members have also left the group, the Blade reported.
After the Log Cabin endorsement, Trump called it an “honor” and claimed, “Some of my biggest supporters are of that community.”
The Log Cabin Republicans refused to endorse Trump in 2016, and according to exit polls he won just 14 percent of the LGBTQ vote.
