An inspector observed at least one employee did not change their single-use gloves between tasks or after they got dirty.
Cold food was stored at temperatures 10 degrees warmer than allowed, an inspector found, and one walk-in cooler that contained meat and dairy was too warm and needed repairs. Moreover, the report cites “approximately 10 to 11 live roaches,” including several near the dishwasher and two behind ovens.
This was an apparent improvement over 2012, when inspectors reportedly found rodent droppings in addition to roaches in the kitchen.
The Doral, which Trump purchased in 2012 with the help of $125 million in loans from Deutsche Bank, supplies Trump with more revenue than any of his other hotels. The Trump Organization did not return a request for comment on Doral’s inspection history Tuesday. 
Despite the resort’s previous issues, however, investigators found almost no problems during a May inspection.
