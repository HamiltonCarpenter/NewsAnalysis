“It occurs very infrequently, but every pollster who has been in this business a while recognizes that outliers happen,” Mr. Murray said. “This appears to be one of those instances.”
Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, have established themselves in a tier above the rest of the Democratic field. No other candidate has consistently reached double-digit support in recent surveys; in the Quinnipiac and Suffolk polls, the only other candidates with 5 percent or better were Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. More than a dozen of the Democrats got just 1 percent — or less.
The Quinnipiac poll, conducted Aug. 21-26, and the Suffolk poll, conducted Aug. 20-25, had margins of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points among Democratic voters. The Monmouth poll, conducted Aug. 16-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus six points. All three were conducted by telephone.
The committee requires that candidates land 130,000 individual donors and 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls in order to make the debate stage.
The billionaire impeachment activist Tom Steyer was close to meeting those benchmarks, collecting enough donors and hitting the 2 percent requirement in three polls so far. But he failed to reach 2 percent in either of the polls published Wednesday morning, leaving him one poll short as the midnight deadline approached.
