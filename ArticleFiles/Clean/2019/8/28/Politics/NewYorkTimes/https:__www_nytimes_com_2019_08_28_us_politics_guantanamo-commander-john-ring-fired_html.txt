Defense lawyers for the prisoner, Abd al Hadi al Iraqi, had sought information about the firing to argue that Mr. Hadi’s health care was not in compliance with the Geneva Conventions. Navy surgeons conducted five spine surgeries on him at Guantánamo in nine months, starting in September 2017. He now relies on a wheelchair, a walker and painkillers.
But Commander Flynn said Admiral Ring’s firing had nothing to do with the Hadi case or his public advocacy for “improvements of detention facilities.” He said that an investigation found that the admiral had mishandled classified information and that he was not candid about it. The prosecutor did not elaborate on the nature of the information or how it was mishandled, including whether it was disclosed to the public.
The trial judge, Lt. Col. Michael D. Libretto, denied a request by Mr. Hadi’s lawyers for information about the firing. But Colonel Libretto, a Marine, ordered the prosecution to provide defense lawyers with any documents or reports by “knowledgeable officials” that could have informed Admiral Ring’s public statements of deteriorating conditions at the maximum-security lockup where Mr. Hadi is imprisoned.
The building is called Camp 7 and houses 14 men who were previously held by the C.I.A. in its secret “black site” overseas prison network. The other 26 prisoners at Guantánamo are mostly held in two other prison buildings called Camp 5 and Camp 6.
Two prosecutors on the Hadi case traveled to Miami two weeks ago to read the report on the Ring investigation at the headquarters of the Southern Command, which oversees prison operations at Guantánamo, Commander Flynn said. He said prosecutors gave Mr. Hadi’s lawyers an executive summary of the investigation last week. 
The judge was handed a copy in court on Wednesday and read it on the spot.
