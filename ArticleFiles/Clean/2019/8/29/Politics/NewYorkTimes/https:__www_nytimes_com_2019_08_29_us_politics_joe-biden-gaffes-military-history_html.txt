After The Washington Post reported that Mr. Biden had conflated several stories into one anecdote, the former vice president insisted the contours of the tale were accurate.
“I was making the point how courageous these people are, how incredible they are, this generation of warriors, these fallen angels we’ve lost,” he told Jonathan Capehart, a Washington Post opinion columnist, in a podcast interview. “And so, I don’t know what the problem is. I mean, what is it that I said wrong?”
“There’s no question about that, especially if you compare him to some of the people that he’s running against,” he added. “Elizabeth Warren is not going to get her facts wrong very often. Kamala Harris, the prosecutor, is not going to get her facts wrong very often. You’ve got some very tough opponents who are really smart and are going to nail it every time in terms of the facts and the sequence, and he may look badly compared to people like that.”
Mr. Lux and other Democrats who have known Mr. Biden for decades emphasize that his verbal blunders — and exaggerations — are nothing new. And they argue that plenty of voters have come to expect them from Mr. Biden, who has himself made light of his propensity for gaffes. 
If elected, Mr. Biden, who is 76, would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, though Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of his chief rivals for the Democratic nomination, is older, at 77. President Trump, who has faced questions about his mental fitness, is 73.
“You can definitely tell his age,” said Bryce Smith, the Democratic chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, when asked about Mr. Biden’s misstatements, even as he also noted that “no one is perfect” and nodded to the former vice president’s “lifetime of service.” 
“As a 27-year-old,” Mr. Smith added, “it’s harder for me to relate to how he talks, per se, than it is to relate to someone who’s half his age running for president. It doesn’t mean he’s wrong.”
“Time and again, the press fixates on supposed Joe Biden ‘gaffes’ — and time and again, voters say they don’t care,” Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden’s campaign, said.
David Axelrod, who served as former President Barack Obama’s chief strategist, said the episode of the fumbled war story “reflects both the lack of discipline and the extraordinary empathy” of Mr. Biden.
“In this story you have the risk and the strength of Biden,” Mr. Axelrod said. “The risk being that he is a gaffe-prone guy, and we’ve seen that throughout his career. I don’t know whether it’s better or worse now, but it’s a factor, and at his age people are going to pay more attention to each of them. But on the other hand, he projects extraordinary empathy, and that empathy is a huge strength.”
