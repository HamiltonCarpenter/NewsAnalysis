On Politics With Lisa Lerer
It was the week the bloated Democratic primary field finally went on a crash diet.
Already, there are signs that the nonqualifiers may soon find their presence in the race increasingly difficult to justify. A number of them felt compelled to release statements this morning explaining their decision to keep going.
“Our campaign is focused on the old-school tactics like taking our message directly to the voters and caucusgoers in the communities of the early states,” said a campaign adviser to Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio.
Tom Steyer’s campaign manager blamed the polls. “It is clear from public polling that Tom would have easily met the 2 percent threshold and been on the debate stage if there had been any qualified early state polling in the last few weeks,” she said.
And former Representative John Delaney cast himself as a singular voice amid the crowd. “I remain committed to the campaign for one simple reason: Someone has to be consistently telling the truth,” he said.
Before we go any further, a quick reality check: Making the debate stage did not require meeting a particularly high standard when you consider the job these people hope to eventually win. All it took was 130,000 donors and capturing 2 percent in four qualifying polls.
Going forward, the path isn’t going to get any easier. For months, I’ve listened to Democrats complain that the field is simply too big. Primary voters — the very people these candidates hope to win over — are practically begging for candidates to drop out of the race.
Of course, it is possible that some of the nine who have been left behind may qualify for the October debate. The standard stays the same, giving them a few extra weeks to rack up donors and rise in the polls.
Most candidates don’t have the benefit of Mr. Steyer’s billions. But the march to a slightly slimmer field that began this week seems sure to continue.

On Joe Biden’s first trip to New Hampshire as a 2020 presidential candidate, I stood inside a community college lobby in Manchester, chatting with a voter as we prepared to dash to our cars amid a torrential storm after his event.
The voter mentioned offhand that she had hugged Mr. Biden, but that she had been the one to request the hug.
The unusual caveat caught my attention, so I wrote it down before venturing outside.
But the women waiting in line to hug Joe Biden, many of them ardent Democrats from an older and less progressive generation, are a reminder of the significant good will he continues to enjoy from some voters, despite a summer of gaffes and controversies.
