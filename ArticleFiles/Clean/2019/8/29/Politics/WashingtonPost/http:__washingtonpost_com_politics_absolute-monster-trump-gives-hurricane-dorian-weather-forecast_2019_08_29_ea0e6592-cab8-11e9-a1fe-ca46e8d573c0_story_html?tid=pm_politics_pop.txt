President Trump made dire predictions Thursday for Hurricane Dorian’s potential landfall, warning that the storm was likely going to “hit very hard” and “be very big.”
The storm is forecast to become a major hurricane on Friday and possibly hit Florida’s east coast early next week.

Trump notes that “we got lucky” because the storm mostly grazed Puerto Rico. Earlier this week, as Hurricane Dorian threatened the island, Trump taunted the U.S. territory in a series of tweets.
In the video, taped in the Rose Garden, Trump speaks directly into the camera for a minute and a half about the looming storm.
“It’s looking like it could be an absolute monster,” Trump says. He adds that someone told him it could be “bigger or at least as big as Andrew,” referring to the 1992 Category 5 hurricane that devastated Florida.
