A storm is brewing in Rockland County, N.Y., a campaign ad says.
Then it takes a turn. County Legislator Aron Wieder, an Orthodox Jew who supports new housing developments, is “plotting a takeover” that threatens “our way of life,” the advertisement proclaims. After the video asks what’s at stake, the words “Our Families” are overlaid on a photo of a white, non-Orthodox couple and their children posing on a front lawn.
Rockland County Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Garvey said the party’s complaints were not a religious issue. They were about people’s fear of losing their homes and neighborhoods to corrupt politicians supporting a corrupt overdevelopment process, he said.
County Executive Ed Day (R) called the video’s content factual and the conversation topic necessary but said the “undercurrent” was unacceptable. He said he had asked Garvey to remove the video.
