Franken was a liberal darling and among the highest-profile members of Congress to lose their job in the Me Too era. At first, as multiple women made misconduct allegations against Franken — spanning a decade — Senate Democrats called for an ethics investigation (which could languish for years) but did not ask him to resign.
“There were new allegations today, and enough is enough,” Gillibrand said at a news conference in December 2017 as Franken’s seventh accuser was reported. “We need to draw a line in the sand and say none of it is okay, none of it is acceptable. We as elected leaders should absolutely be held to a higher standard, not a lower standard, and we should fundamentally be valuing women. That is where this debate has to go.”
More broadly, Senate Democrats were trying to get a Democrat elected in Alabama in a month, against a Republican opponent accused of inappropriate sexual behavior toward teenage girls when he was in his 30s.
(That’s not to say politics led the way for Gillibrand or these other senators on pushing Franken out, but politics is always inextricably part of the conversation when #MeToo comes to Congress.)
But Gillibrand was the one haunted by this, likely because she was the first to say it publicly. Getting rid of Franken, from the point of view of her Democratic critics at every level of the party, was unforgivable. He was a potential 2020 contender. He was one of the party’s sharpest, most profound critics of Trump. At a time when Democrats needed all tools at their disposal to battle against Trump, Franken was considered indispensable.
In his last Senate speech, it was clear he was begrudgingly leaving: “I know there’s been a very different picture of me painted over the last few weeks, but I know who I really am.”
The not-so-subtle message to his supporters: I’m being unfairly pushed out. And fairly or not, Gillibrand was targeted as the reason.
