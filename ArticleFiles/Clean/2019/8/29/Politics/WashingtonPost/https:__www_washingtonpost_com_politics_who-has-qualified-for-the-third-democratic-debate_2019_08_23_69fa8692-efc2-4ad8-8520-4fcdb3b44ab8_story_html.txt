The next Democratic debate will treat viewers to a spectacle unseen this cycle — all of the qualifying candidates debating on the same stage, on the same night.
To qualify, candidates had to register at least 2 percent in four of the 21 qualifying polls and earn donations from at least 130,000 individuals by Wednesday, Aug. 28.

Candidates on the bubble have missed their chance this round. In two qualifying polls released Wednesday morning, no candidate earned more than 2 percent who has not already qualified for the debate.

The fourth Democratic debate will happen in October and has the same polling requirements. That gives Tom Steyer, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Marianne Williamson additional time to get the four polls they need to make the stage.
The seven remaining candidates have not hit 2 percent in any qualifying polls or reached the 130,000 unique donor threshold.
Reaching the donor threshold has been easier for most candidates than increasing their standing in polls. All of the 13 candidates who’ve had at least one qualifying poll have already reached the donor threshold.

Before Gillibrand dropped out Wednesday, she spent nearly $600,000 on Facebook ads specifically about debates — more than any other candidate besides Steyer. Gabbard asked supporters in an email to sign up for YouGov and answer calls from unknown numbers in an attempt to reach 2 percent in qualifying polls.
