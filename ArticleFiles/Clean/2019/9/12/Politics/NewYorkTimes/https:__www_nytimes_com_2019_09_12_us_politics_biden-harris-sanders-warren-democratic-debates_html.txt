Here’s a refresher on the high points, and low points, including some of the more memorable lines of the primary race so far.
It’s usually the moderator who cuts off a candidate. In this case Mr. Biden did it to himself, bringing to a close his lackluster response after Ms. Harris confronted him.
During an exchange about climate change at the first debate, Mr. Sanders raised his hand to signal that he wanted to speak. But the moderators ignored him and turned instead to John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado. The moment typified the night for Mr. Sanders, who at times all but disappeared from the conversation even as his ideas took center stage at the debate.
One thing is certain on Thursday night: This particular fight will not be revived, as Mr. Delaney failed to qualify for the debate.
