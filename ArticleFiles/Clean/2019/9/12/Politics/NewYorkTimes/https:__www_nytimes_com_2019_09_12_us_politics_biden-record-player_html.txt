The former vice president’s solution for inequality in schools touched on giving teachers a raise and playing a record player at night so children could hear more words. 
His response rambled, discussing a record player and invoking his current wife and his deceased wife — who both worked as teachers — then ended with a reference to a figure who had come up in an earlier, unrelated question: President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. 
The exchange began when Ms. Davis, pointing out Mr. Biden’s past comment, asked him whether he currently thinks Americans need to repair the legacy of slavery in the United States. 
Number two, make sure that we bring in to help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home. We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. It’s crazy. The teachers are — I’m married to a teacher, my deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. Make sure that every single child does, does in fact, have 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds go to school. Not day care, school. 
We bring social workers into some and parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It’s not that they don’t want to help, they don’t know what — they don’t know quite what to do. Play the radio, make sure the television — excuse me, make sure you have the record player — on at night, make sure that kids hear words, a kid coming from a very poor school — a very poor background will hear 4 million words fewer spoken by the time we get there.
“Well, that was quite a lot,” said Mr. Castro, before recalling his own childhood in a segregated neighborhood in San Antonio.
