The candidates were asked about a wide range of topics over three hours, but abortion and the gender pay gap never came up.
But questions on issues like reproductive rights and the gender pay gap were entirely absent Thursday night. 
None of the Democratic candidates spoke at length about the issues on their own.
In the second set of debates, the candidates wrestled with the wage gap, discussing Ms. Harris’s equal pay plan. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang steered his answer on universal basic income to address sexism and harassment in the workplace.
Toward the end of the debate Thursday, the three women on the stage — Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ms. Harris — discussed motherhood and their careers. Ms. Klobuchar told a story about how she had been forced to leave a hospital as a new mother after 24 hours, and explained that she had fought for a law that would guarantee longer stays. Ms. Warren recalled how, years ago, she had lost her job as a special-education teacher upon becoming pregnant. And Ms. Harris discussed the influence of her mother and the barriers she had broken by winning public office as a black woman. 
Otherwise, the Houston debate focused heavily on topics that other debates have covered extensively: health care, immigration, climate change and gun control.
