A jury has found the father of Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes guilty of illegally funneling contributions to his daughter’s 2014 campaign against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Reached by phone, Lundergan referred questions to his legal team.
J. Guthrie True, a lawyer for Lundergan, said his client plans to appeal.
“We are disappointed in the verdict but we understood from the outset that the deck would be stacked against us with prejudicial evidence that we believe was erroneously admitted,” True said in a statement. He added that Lundergan’s team is “confident that the campaign finance laws have been improperly applied in this case and that Mr. Lundergan will ultimately be vindicated.”
Grimes’s office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
