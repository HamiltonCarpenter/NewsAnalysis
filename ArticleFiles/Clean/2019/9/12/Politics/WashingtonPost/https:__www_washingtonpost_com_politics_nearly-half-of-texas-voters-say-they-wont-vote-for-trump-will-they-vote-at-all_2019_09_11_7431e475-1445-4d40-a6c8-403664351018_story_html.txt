Trump’s job performance was viewed more negatively there than in Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin. He won those states by 78,000 votes, handing him an electoral college edge and the White House. If he’d lost Texas in 2016, though? That alone would have been enough for Hillary Clinton to prevail and head back to Washington.
The eternal question — at least until next November — is how the near-universal mediocrity of Trump’s approval numbers will translate at the polls. To answer that, Quinnipiac was direct, evaluating if respondents to its poll would definitely or definitely not vote for Trump’s likely reelection bid.
Democrats, expectedly, were overwhelmingly unified in opposing Trump’s reelection. Republicans were mostly supportive of voting for Trump again, though only about three-quarters said they would definitely support him. More than half of independents came down in opposition to a second Trump term.
If you’ve been paying attention to polling over the last two years (or, really, four years), the other splits above will look familiar. White Texans, like white Americans generally, are more favorably inclined toward Trump than black and Hispanic Texans. Whites without college degrees are more enthusiastic than those who’ve graduated college. Men view Trump more positively than women and plan to vote for him more heavily.
If there are more Democrats than Republicans and Democrats oppose Trump’s election more strongly than Republicans support it, that’s game over, right? Barring some movement in the polls over the next (cough) 14 months, how can Trump win?
Or those voters might not vote simply because they are less frequent voters.
Three-quarters of the Republicans currently on the voter rolls voted in 2016. Only a bit over half of Democrats did. Nearly 7 in 10 white women who are active voters cast a ballot in 2016, but, again, only about half of nonwhite women did.
And, therefore, have a shot at four more years.
