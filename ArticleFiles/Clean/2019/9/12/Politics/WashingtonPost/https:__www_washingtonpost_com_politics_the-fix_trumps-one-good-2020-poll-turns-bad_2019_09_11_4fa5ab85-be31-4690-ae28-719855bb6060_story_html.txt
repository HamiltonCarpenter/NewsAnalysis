Now that has been taken from him, too.
Trump’s nine-point deficit against Sen. Bernie Sanders (52-43) is tied for his second-highest in high-quality national polls. Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s seven-point lead (51-44) is tied for her second-biggest, too. And Sen. Kamala D. Harris’s seven-point lead is her third-biggest.
....This is a phony suppression poll, meant to build up their Democrat partners. I haven’t even started campaigning yet, and am constantly fighting Fake News like Russia, Russia, Russia. Look at North Carolina last night. Dan Bishop, down big in the Polls, WINS. Easier than 2016!
But the likelihood that that will hold is almost nil. In American politics today, it’s rare for a politician who is well-known to stay above water in image ratings (i.e., having a favorable or approval rating higher than their unfavorable or disapproval rating). Once the campaign gets going, people who don’t know much about these Democrats will begin to find things they don’t like. And Trump has a talent for getting down in the political mud with his opponents.
The 2016 election showed just how fruitful that can be. While 6 in 10 Americans didn’t like Trump, by the end of the campaign, that was also true of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. The question is how much of that was because Clinton was already a polarizing figure in American politics or was just a bad candidate.
All of that said, it’s very early, of course. What we can say is that the president seems to have his work cut out for him.
