To a large extent, President Trump’s politics were formed in the cauldron of conservative politics during President Barack Obama’s first term in office. On the campaign trail in 2015 and 2016, he railed against things like the Affordable Care Act and Common Core, figuring, correctly, that his base of support would react as favorably to those triggers as he might.
Of course, that wasn’t really his nature. As a businessman, Trump relied on debt. At one point during the campaign, he called himself the “king of debt,” a bit of bragging about how he had increased his wealth. As it turns out, though, that bit of bragging was a better predictor of his presidency than his pledges to keep the debt under control.
(A function in part of the decrease in the debt — but also, certainly, of Obama’s reelection.)
Since the administration of President Bill Clinton, there have been two periods of massive federal deficits. The first was during Obama’s first term, in the aftermath of a recession. The other is now, in the aftermath of ... well, tax cuts, in part.
Here’s the monthly buildup of the deficit since Clinton’s first term.
In fairness, he’s also seen the one month with a surplus that large, but his term in office has seen a greater percentage of months with deficits — 75 percent — than any presidential term in the past 30 years save Obama’s first.
Asked how you renegotiate the federal debt, Trump said it was simple.
“You go back and you say, hey guess what, the economy crashed,” he said. “I’m going to give you back half” of what I owe.
The president of debt has yet to try that tactic.
