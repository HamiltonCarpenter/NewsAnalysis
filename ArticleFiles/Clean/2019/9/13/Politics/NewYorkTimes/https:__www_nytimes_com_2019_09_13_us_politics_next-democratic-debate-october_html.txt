The Democratic National Committee has announced that the next debate will be held on Oct. 15, with a possible second night on Oct. 16. 
The Democratic National Committee announced Friday that the debate would be held in Westerville, Ohio, on the campus of Otterbein University. The moderators will be the CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett as well as The Times’s National editor, Marc Lacey.
The criteria for October are the same as those for September: Candidates must have 130,000 unique donors and register at least 2 percent support in four qualifying polls.
Mr. Steyer, the billionaire investor and impeachment activist, made the cut after a recent CBS News/YouGov poll showed him at 2 percent in Nevada, a key early-voting state.
Along with Mr. Steyer, the October debate will feature:
Two other candidates have met the 130,000-donor threshold but have not met the polling threshold:
Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii
Marianne Williamson, a self-help author
Ms. Gabbard has two qualifying polls and needs two more; Ms. Williamson has only one qualifying poll and needs three more.
The remaining seven candidates have met neither threshold:
Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado
Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana
Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York
Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland
Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla.
Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio
Former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania
None of these candidates have reached 2 percent in any qualifying polls, and the race would need to fundamentally change for any of them to make the debate stage.

The 10-candidate debate format on Thursday made it challenging for the candidates to delve deeply into multiple issues, and relatively little time was spent on the economy, taxes, tech or abortion rights.
