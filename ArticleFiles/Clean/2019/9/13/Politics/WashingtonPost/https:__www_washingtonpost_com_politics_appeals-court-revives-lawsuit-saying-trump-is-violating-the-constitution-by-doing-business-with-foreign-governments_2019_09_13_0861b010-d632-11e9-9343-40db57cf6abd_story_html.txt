A federal appeals court on Friday revived a previously dismissed lawsuit against President Trump, which alleges Trump is violating the Constitution by engaging in business transactions with foreign governments.
But, if Trump appeals, as is expected, the case could go to the full 2nd Circuit — and possibly to the Supreme Court after that.
This suit was the first of three major lawsuits alleging that Trump is violating the emoluments clause.
In this case, the plaintiffs were Trump’s business competitors, a hotel operator and a group of restaurants and restaurant workers who say Trump is using the presidency to give his businesses a competitive advantage. Along with hotel rooms and steaks, they say, he can sell something they cannot: access to power, and a chance to please the president.
In Friday’s ruling, the two judges on the New York-based appeals court — both appointed by Democratic presidents — revived it. They said it was not necessary to identify a specific customer that Trump had lured away, at least not at this early stage of the lawsuit.
“The district court effectively required plaintiffs to prove, pre-discovery, the facts necessary to win at trial,” Judges Pierre N. Leval and Christopher F. Droney wrote. They said that the businesses had plausibly sketched out how they might be affected — and that that was enough to continue to the fact-gathering stage of the case.
Judge John M. Walker Jr., appointed by President Ronald Reagan, dissented, saying the case should be thrown out.
The Justice Department, which is representing Trump in this case, did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
Deepak Gupta, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the case was intended to enforce the original intent of the Constitution’s framers: to bar presidents from having private business relationships with foreign states.
