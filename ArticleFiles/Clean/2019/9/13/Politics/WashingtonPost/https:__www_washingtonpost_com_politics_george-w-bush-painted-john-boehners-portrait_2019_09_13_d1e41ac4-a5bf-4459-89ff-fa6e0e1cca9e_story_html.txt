When former House speaker John A. Boehner retired from Congress, he was gifted a portrait painted by a very famous artist: former president George W. Bush.
Boehner revealed his likeness in an interview with Barstool Sports; podcast host Uncle Chaps tweeted out an image of the painting on Friday.
A Boehner spokesman confirmed the painting was a parting gift from the former president. It will not, however, be the official portrait hanging in the Speaker’s Lobby.
Boehner and Bush remain close in retirement. In a 2017 interview with Politico Magazine, Boehner referred to them as “two peas in the same pod,” noting how they both approached their stressful jobs with a similar easygoing manner.
A few hours later, Bush sent an updated salt-and-pepper version.
