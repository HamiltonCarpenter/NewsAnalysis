The top two candidates identify as populists.
As a communication strategist, Karoui has used his TV platform for years to air Turkish soap operas to attract a female electorate. He has also boosted his appeal to popular social classes with intermissions showing the work of the charity organization he established in the name of his deceased son, Yarham Khalil.
Second in the polls is another anti-elitist populist, Kais Saied, a university professor of constitutional law who is proposing to end the party-based electoral system. He is expected to be a serious contender in the runoff elections in October. Both his and Karoui’s candidacies indicate a probable populist wave among voters.
There is a probable Tunisian populist wave.
Reactionary support for populist candidates can grow from the perception of failed governance. Linking elite-level politics with corruption further widens the gap between voters and the electoral process. The recent coalition government brought together different factions of the two winning parties of the 2014 election: the secular Nidaa Tounes party and the Islamists of Ennahda. But this coalition failed to engage with the concerns of many Tunisians, creating a void that resulted in a growing number of Tunisians who seek a fresh approach. The populists are feeding off this sentiment, which could kick most of the political elite out of their jobs.
Moreover, for Karoui, there is a direct connection with world figures of populism, as he is a business partner of none other than Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy. But his use of a charity to seduce voters and suggest a distrust in government institutions may be seen as unusual. He touts the image of a wealthy and visible financier speaking to the masses.
Election results may face scrutiny.
The accusations point mainly to the head of government — Youssef Chahed, also a presidential candidate — suggesting he and his party might not accept the election results. He is being accused of attempting to “keep” Karoui in prison. Many believe that Chahed fears that if Karoui and others get elected into power, they would use the judiciary to prosecute him on corruption charges. Some even suggest that Chahed would not leave office if he loses and would use all means available to him, including invalidating via parliament the election of Karoui. Such an ambiguous and uncertain environment might increase the electorate’s distrust of the political elite.
This probable populist wave and possible attempt to refuse election results could alienate popular support for democracy. There are a few candidates who represent democratic parties — as well as the demands of social movements — and defend social democratic alternatives. Chief among them is Mohamed Abbou, who seems to be trailing in the polls. Such candidates may be the only hope of combating the formerly tolerated corruption and crony capitalism. If those interested in building a sustainable democracy do not recognize this powerful trend toward anti-establishment populism and politics as a means to avoid persecution, the consolidation of a genuinely representative and structurally inclusive democracy will be difficult to achieve.
