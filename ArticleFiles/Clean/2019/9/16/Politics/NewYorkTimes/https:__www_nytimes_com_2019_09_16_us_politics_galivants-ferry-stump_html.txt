The Galivants Ferry Stump speaking event in South Carolina has been held every two years for at least 143 years. Now, for the first time, it will host Democratic presidential candidates.
For more than a century, South Carolina Democrats seeking political office have traveled by horseback and automobile to a general store on the banks of the Pee Dee River to make their case to curious voters. Their destination: the biennial stump meeting in Galivants Ferry, S.C., which has been hosted by different generations of the same family since the late 1800s. 
“A whole new presidential edition,” Sally P. Howard, the event’s director, said. “We’re excited — and nervous.”
“True old-timey retail politics,” she said. “It’ll be quite the festival.” 
Speaking about Mr. de Blasio, she added: “We think it’s really fun that the mayor of the largest city will come to a town with only a blinking light. He’s going to see real, rural South Carolina.”
As for a stump — well, organizers had one made that serves as a podium. Ms. Howard conceded that it was hard to know with certainty whether there was an actual tree stump near the store in the 1800s, but, as the story goes, there was a thicket full of them on the property, and candidates certainly could have spoken there.
Ms. Howard said that the first record of a stump event in Galivants Ferry — now an unincorporated community in Horry County, which borders North Carolina — appeared in a notice that told of Gen. Wade Hampton coming to the town in September 1876 to initiate his campaign for governor. Four years later, a local businessman, Joseph W. Holliday, invited county Democratic candidates to speak at his Galivants Ferry store. Organizers say the Holliday family has been hosting the event on their property ever since.
It will return, as normal, in 2020.
