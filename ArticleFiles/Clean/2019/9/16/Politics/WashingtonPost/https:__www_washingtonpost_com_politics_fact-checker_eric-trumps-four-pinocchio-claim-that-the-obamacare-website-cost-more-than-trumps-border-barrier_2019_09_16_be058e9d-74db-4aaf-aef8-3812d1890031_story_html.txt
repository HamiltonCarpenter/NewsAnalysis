“President Trump’s wall costs less than the Obamacare website. Let that sink in, America.” 
Eric Trump, one of the president’s sons, has quite a following on social media, so his posts attract a lot of attention. This particular one achieved nearly 80,000 likes within days.
But there are two big problems. First, it’s factually incorrect. Second, while Allen is a conservative, he did not say this. A query to the Trump Organization, where Trump is executive vice president, for comment did not receive a response.
What about the claim itself? Has the wall cost less than the Obamacare website?
No.
This is a game of telephone that has spun out of control. A debunked claim from earlier this year somehow emerged on Nugent’s Facebook page and was copied by a Virginia man with the same name as an actor. The inaccurate claim was then falsely attributed to Tim Allen — and was distributed around the world by the president’s son.
Eric Trump earns Four Pinocchios. He should delete this post immediately. With his social media platform, he should not be distributing double falsehoods.
