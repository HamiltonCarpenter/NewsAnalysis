Confused about what new gun laws Congress is going to make after a summer of back-to-back mass shootings? So is Congress, apparently.
The most difficult task seems to be finding common ground on background checks, specifically enough common ground that a majority of senators — maybe even a supermajority if some conservatives in the Senate launch a filibuster — agree. Here are the most-talked about proposals and their factions:
But now some of those Republicans are open to expanding some background checks, notably Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who chairs the key committee for such bills and who has become a Trump confidant, and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who chairs another committee more focused on mental health and mass shootings.
It’s notable that this is the most obvious compromise, and Trump has not yet embraced it despite lobbying from Toomey and Manchin.
The Post also reported that Trump was open to an app that would make the background checks that exist more accessible to gun sellers.
There is recent precedent for Republicans successfully nibbling around the edges of background checks. In 2018 after mass shootings at a Parkland, Fla., high school, a church in Texas and an open-air concert in Las Vegas, Trump signed into law a bipartisan bill requiring federal agencies and states to more thoroughly report people’s criminal records to the federal background-check system.
It was a modest effort to make it more expansive, and it didn’t come easy in a Republican-controlled Washington. The legislation passed only when it got folded into a must-pass spending bill.
