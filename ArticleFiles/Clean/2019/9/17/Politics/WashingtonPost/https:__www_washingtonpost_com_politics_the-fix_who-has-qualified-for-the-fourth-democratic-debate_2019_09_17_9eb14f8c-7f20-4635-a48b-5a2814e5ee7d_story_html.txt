The Democratic National Committee raised the bar for debate qualification this fall in an attempt to narrow the field. But because of a quirk in the party’s rules, there are already more candidates qualified for the October debate than there were for September’s.

The tougher qualification rules did have some impact. Five candidates dropped out of the race in July and August: Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). But 20 Democrats remain.
Two other candidates have registered at least 2 percent in any qualifying poll: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and author Marianne Williamson. Both say they have met the individual donor threshold.

Pollsters don’t typically announce their release schedules in advance, so it is not clear how many more chances Williamson or Gabbard will have to qualify before the Oct. 1 deadline. But a qualifying poll has been released roughly every three days in recent months.
