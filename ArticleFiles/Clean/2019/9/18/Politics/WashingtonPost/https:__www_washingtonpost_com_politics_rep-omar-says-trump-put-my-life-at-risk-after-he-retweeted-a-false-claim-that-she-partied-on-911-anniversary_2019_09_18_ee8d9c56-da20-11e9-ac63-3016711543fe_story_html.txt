Rep. Ilhan Omar on Wednesday accused President Trump of spreading “lies that put my life at risk” after the president retweeted a post falsely claiming that the Minnesota Democrat “partied on the anniversary of 9/11.”
“Twitter must remove Trump’s Tweet now,” the organization said.
A spokeswoman for Twitter said it was looking into the matter.
“I need to talk to Omar,” Williams said in the video. “Girl, what in the world were you celebrating on the anniversary of 9/11? ... I need everybody in America to wake up. We have a congresswoman in office that believes that on 9/11, ‘some people just did something,’ and she partied on the anniversary of 9/11. Does this sound American to you?”
Williams concluded the video by suggesting that Omar should “fly your butt back to where you came from.”
Later Wednesday afternoon, after his tweet was deleted, Williams pointed the finger back at Democrats, arguing that they “make up lies” about Trump “everyday.”
