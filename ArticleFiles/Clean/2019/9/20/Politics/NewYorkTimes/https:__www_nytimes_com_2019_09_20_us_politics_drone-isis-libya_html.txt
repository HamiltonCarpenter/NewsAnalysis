WASHINGTON — The United States military carried out an airstrike against Islamic State fighters in southern Libya on Thursday in a reminder of the terrorist group’s continuing operations and resilience far from its main guerrilla strongholds in Iraq and Syria.
The Pentagon’s Africa Command said in a statement on Friday that the strike — which other officials said was carried out by an Air Force Reaper drone based in neighboring Niger — killed eight militants in a compound in Murzuq, Libya, nearly 600 miles south of Tripoli, the capital.
“We will not allow them to use the current conflict in Libya as protection,” Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the head of the Africa Command, said in statement, noting that the strike was coordinated with the Libyan government in Tripoli.
“The strike serves to remind us that while ISIS and Al Qaeda are not at the forefront of the fighting in Libya these days, these groups still remain a threat to Libya, neighboring countries and the international community,” said Bill Roggio, the editor of The Long War Journal, a website run by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that tracks military strikes against militant groups.
American counterterrorism operations in southern Libya entered a new phase when a military drone strike in March 2018 killed a top recruiter and logistics specialist for Al Qaeda’s branch in northwest Africa. That attack killed two militants, including one identified by American officials as Musa Abu Dawud, a high-ranking official in Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Until that strike, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north. Over several months in 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt to destroy the Islamic State’s stronghold there.
