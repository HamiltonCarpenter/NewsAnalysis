The president, in a wide-ranging conversation with the Australian prime minister on Friday in the presence of reporters, falsely claimed NASA facilities “were virtually closed” before he took office. 
What Trump Said
If you look at our facilities, they were virtually closed up. There was crabgrass growing on the runways. And now they’re vital and we’re — we’re doing — we’re going to Mars. We’re stopping at the moon.
President Trump, like some of his predecessors, has retooled the government’s space program. But space exploration had not grinded to a halt before he took office in 2017. In fact, NASA for years has been aiming for a trip to Mars.
Casey Dreier of the Planetary Society, a nonprofit that promotes space exploration, said that the Trump administration “has been unusually attentive to space” but noted that it has “generally continued policies established over the past 15 years, and benefited from a rapidly maturing commercial space industry that has taken decades to develop.”
Beyond these changes in mission, NASA has continued to operate and reach milestones.
What Trump Said
“Germany, France, Russia, many other countries made a lot of money with Iran. And we didn’t make money with Iran, which that was just one of the many bad parts about the deal.”
