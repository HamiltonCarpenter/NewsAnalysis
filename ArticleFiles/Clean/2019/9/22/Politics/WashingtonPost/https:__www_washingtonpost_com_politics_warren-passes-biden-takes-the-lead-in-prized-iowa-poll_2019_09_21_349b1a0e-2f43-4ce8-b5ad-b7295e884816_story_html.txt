DES MOINES — Sen. Elizabeth Warren surged in a respected poll of likely Iowa caucus-goers released on Saturday, testing former vice president Joe Biden’s dominance in the state.
The poll was conducted Sept. 14-18 among 602 probable caucusgoers, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Filling out the top five were Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.). Buttigieg, whose campaign had a commanding presence at Saturday’s Polk County Steak Fry, fell by 6 percentage points from the June poll.
Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) were both at 3 percent, ahead of a cluster of candidates registering at 2 percent and eight others polling at 1 percent or less.
The results show considerable room for movement over the next half-year. Only 1 in 5 likely caucusgoers said they were set on their first-choice candidate, while 63 percent said they could envision supporting someone else.
Sixty-three percent also said it was more important to them that the winner of the Iowa caucuses could beat President Trump than that the victor in February shared their positions on major issues.
Warren has steadily gained ground in the Register’s polling, starting at 8 percent in December, before she had announced her candidacy. She came in at 9 percent in March and 15 percent in June.
Jodi Stanfield, a volunteer for Warren in Des Moines, said she previously supported Sanders and admired both candidates, whose platforms she described as similarly ambitious on issues of health care and education. She now favors Warren because she can “actually get the work done,” said Stanfield, 51, who works at the YMCA of Greater Des Moines.
