The president, facing calls for impeachment over his pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival, inaccurately accused European countries of not providing aid to Ukraine. 
What Trump Said
But Mr. Trump is wrong that other countries do not contribute to Ukraine’s efforts to counteract Russian aggression in recent years.
Aid across different countries is difficult to compare, as there is no single publicly accessible source that aggregates all forms of assistance. And some sources of data shows that the European Union has actually provided more aid to Ukraine than the United States. 
“The European Union’s support to Ukraine in the past 5 years has been unprecedented and consistent,” Maja Kocijancic, the European Union spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said in a statement.
NATO also set up a number of trust funds to help Ukraine develop military defense capabilities. A NATO official said that allies had pledged 40 million euros, or about $44 million, through the trust funds and that individual allies had their own bilateral assistance programs with Ukraine.
Asked whether Mr. Trump had a point about European contributions in comparison to the United States’ funding, Mr. Emerson suggested a reformulation: “U.S. assistance pales in comparison to that of the E.U.”
