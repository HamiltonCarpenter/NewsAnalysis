But it also reveals the lengths to which foreign leaders will go in their private conversations with Trump to flatter the president in an effort to win his favor.
Most significantly, Zelensky mentioned that he stayed at one of Trump’s properties.
“Actually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,” Zelensky told Trump, according to the rough transcript.
On the July phone call, Zelensky also complimented Trump’s skill as a campaigner, telling him, “We worked a lot, but I would like to confess to you that I had an opportunity to learn from you.”
“We used quite a few of your skills and knowledge and were able to use it as an example for our elections,” Zelensky said.
He then used one of Trump’s signature phrases — “drain the swamp” — when discussing his own political goals.
“Well yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country. … You are a great teacher for us and in that,” Zelensky said.
And, finally, Zelensky voiced enthusiastic agreement with Trump — regardless of the topic.
“Yes, you are absolutely right,” Zelensky said at one point when Trump declared that the United States “has been very, very good” to Ukraine. “Not only 100 percent, but actually 1,000 percent.”
At another point, Zelensky said he agreed with Trump “100 percent” that the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was “a bad ambassador.”
“It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100 percent,” Zelensky said. “Her attitude towards me was far from the best, as she admired the previous president and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new president well enough.”
