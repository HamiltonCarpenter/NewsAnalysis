During this time period, the administration also blocked former White House Counsel Don McGahn from testifying in relation to the report, saying he was “absolutely immune” from compelled congressional testimony. Several lawmakers came out for impeachment in the following days.

More than 40 additional Democrats supported impeachment after Mueller’s testimony to the House Judiciary Committee on July 24 and during the August recess, including the first lawmakers from districts that Trump won. Reps. Chris Pappas (N.H.) and Lauren Underwood (Ill.) were the first to do so.
One of them was Rep. John Garamendi (Calif.), who, in an interview with The Post on July 25, compared an inquiry to grand jury proceedings. First, open an impeachment inquiry, he said, then “we will see where we go with an impeachment, a formal resolution.”
That same day, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. His conversation would emerge in a whistleblower complaint filed in August. The Post has reported that Trump urged Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter as the administration was holding up congressional appropriations of military and intelligence aid.
Hunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine’s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. As vice president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.
By that time, the House Judiciary Committee had started an investigation into whether it would recommend articles of impeachment against Trump.
Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a Pelosi ally, confirmed the probe in an Aug. 8 interview with CNN and is likely to oversee the impeachment inquiry announced Tuesday.

As Trump this week first acknowledged that he spoke with Zelensky about Biden, then admitted he withheld the aid, while giving various explanations for that decision, a barrage of moderates moved toward impeachment. Several have backgrounds in national security.
“There comes a time when you have to be moved by the spirit of history to take action to protect and preserve the integrity of our nation. I believe, I truly believe, the time to begin impeachment proceedings against this president has come,” Rep. John Lewis (Ga.), a close Pelosi ally who had long remained quiet on the matter, said on the House floor. “To delay or to do otherwise would betray the foundation of our democracy.”
On Tuesday, amid mounting pressure from all sides of her caucus, Pelosi took the step she had long avoided.
