This spring, a nearly two-year investigation found that Trump welcomed Russia’s help in the 2016 election and may have obstructed justice after he got into office. This summer, Trump used racist language to attack four Democratic congresswomen. Pelosi and other powerful House Democrats opposed impeachment through all of that. Until now.
The accusations Trump’s facing are multilayered, but they are simpler to grasp than what former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III found.
Maybe impeachment was a wave that Pelosi just couldn’t hold off any longer.
