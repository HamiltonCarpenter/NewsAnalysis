What would Jay Inslee do?
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee — whose campaign focused on climate change — dropped out of the presidential race two weeks ago. However, his widely lauded climate plan set the bar for all other candidates, with Green New Deal co-sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) referring to it as “the gold standard.”
Timelines and targets
A role for nuclear energy and fossil fuels?
Neither Biden’s nor Warren’s plans specifically mention nuclear energy. Sanders’s plan states it would not extend licenses for nuclear plants.
Support for innovation
Scientists agree tackling climate change will require new and lower-cost technologies: large scale batteries, machines or processes to remove carbon from the air and new solutions enabling heavy industry to operate without emissions. To bring these technologies to market at a competitive cost, the government will need to support research and deployment.
What should you watch for in the climate forums? 
In addition to Biden, Warren and Sanders, the September climate forums will feature other candidates, including entrepreneur Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer, who have also made climate change a central part of their campaigns.
Ultimately, candidates’ climate plans serve several ends. They are symbolic tools that enable them to show they understand the planet is in crisis. They are also road maps for what candidates would do about it — some with far more detail than others. Watch for which candidates can discuss their plans’ details and limitations, making a compelling case for climate action to the American public on national television.
