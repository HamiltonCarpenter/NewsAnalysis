Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said at a recent town hall that lawmakers should discuss fixing Social Security “behind closed doors,” prompting a wave of criticism from liberal and advocacy groups.
Ernst told the audience in Estherville that “there is a point in time when we as Congress will have to address the situation. And I think it’s better done sooner rather than later, to make sure that we’ve shored up that system.”
“So it’s, you know, a broader discussion for another day,” she added. “But I do think, as various parties and members of Congress, we need to sit down behind closed doors so we’re not being scrutinized by this group or the other, and just have an open and honest conversation about what are some of the ideas that we have for maintaining Social Security in the future.”
American Bridge and other groups also seized on Ernst’s remarks.
Kelsi Daniell, a spokeswoman for Ernst, noted that the statements by Democrats appeared to reinforce the very point that Ernst was trying to make at her town hall, where she said that many members of Congress are afraid to raise the issue of Social Security because of political attacks.
“Just as Senator Ernst predicted, we can’t have honest conversations about solving problems anymore without liberals and their media allies trying to demonize it and create a faux controversy,” Daniell said in a statement. “Senator Ernst has always and will continue to stand up and fight to protect Social Security now and for generations to come.”
At the town hall, Ernst had lamented the difficulty lawmakers face in trying to tackle the issue.
“I will tell you that there are very few members of Congress that even want to broach the subject, because it’s become so controversial,” she said Saturday. “And anything you say — ‘we need to address Social Security’ — the media is hammering you. The opposing party will hammer you: ‘There goes granny over a cliff.’ There is a real issue out there.”
