Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker (R) said Friday that his 25-year-old son may campaign to replace retiring 40-year incumbent GOP Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. in Congress next year.
“Well, he’s had a number of people reach out to him,” Scott Walker said in a taped interview that has not yet been aired. “I think in particular what intrigues him is he feels frustrated that AOC somehow nationally is reflective of his generation. He’s 25, and he feels there needs to be a counter-voice to that.”
Sensenbrenner, a fixture in Wisconsin Republican politics, represents a reliably red district, so whoever is the GOP nominee would be expected to handily win the seat.
Scott Walker said his son, who is of the minimum age to be a U.S. House member, asked his dad for advice on whether to run.
“I said, one, you need to pray about it,” Scott Walker said. “If it’s God’s will to get in or not get in, you’ll figure that out first and foremost.”
Scott Walker also told him to consult his girlfriend and business partners — the younger Walker has co-founded a digital strategy firm.
Scott Walker ran a fleeting campaign for president in 2015 and lost a third term as governor in 2018 to Democrat Tony Evers.
If the younger Walker decides to run, he will have some stiff competition. The former governor named former state senator Leah Vukmir, who lost a bid for the U.S. Senate in 2018, and current state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald as formidable candidates to replace Sensenbrenner.
