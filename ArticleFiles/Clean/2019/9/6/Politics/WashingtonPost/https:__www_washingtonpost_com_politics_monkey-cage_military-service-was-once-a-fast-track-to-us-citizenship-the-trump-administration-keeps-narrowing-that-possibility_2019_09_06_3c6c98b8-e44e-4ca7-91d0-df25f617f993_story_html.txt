But what's more important than this particular change is how the new policy fits a trend.

Military service was once a means to U.S. citizenship
The Trump administration has made that harder through a series of small changes
But the Trump administration has pursued a range of policies trying to slow that down.
These policy changes hurt military recruitment and effectiveness
The changes also hurt civil rights efforts for immigrants

Evidence suggests that it may reduce the military’s ability to accomplish its own goals — while also limiting a way that immigrants can claim a more permanent place in American society.
