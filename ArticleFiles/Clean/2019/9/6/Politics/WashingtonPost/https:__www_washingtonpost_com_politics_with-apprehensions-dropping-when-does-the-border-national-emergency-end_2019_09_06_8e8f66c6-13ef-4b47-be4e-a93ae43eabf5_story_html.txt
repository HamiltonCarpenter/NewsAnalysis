But then apprehensions dropped. In July, the most recent month for which data is available, there were about 43,000 family-unit apprehensions and 72,000 in total — not dramatically different from February’s numbers.
It was also not an exceptional figure historically. The number of apprehensions in July 2019 was lower than the same month in each year from 2000 to 2006.
But the recent drop-off in apprehensions raises an important question: When does Trump’s national emergency end? In the abstract, that question centers on the proximate causes cited by the president: If apprehensions fall, is the crisis over? But in practical terms, the answer is direct: It ends when Trump says it ends.
The emergency has never primarily been about apprehensions or migration. It is mainly about building the wall, which was so central to Trump’s 2016 campaign pitch. The emergency, then, will end once the wall is built — or once Trump is out of office.
