President Trump’s campaign manager said Saturday that the president and his family are “a dynasty that will last for decades,” prompting speculation about whether Trump’s children might one day pursue their own bids for public office.
Brad Parscale was speaking at a meeting of Republican Party delegates in Indian Wells, Calif., the Associated Press reported.
In an exchange with reporters after the event, Parscale declined to say whether he thinks Trump’s children might run for office, saying only, “I think they are all amazing people with … amazing capabilities,” the AP reported.
After taking office in 2017, Trump named his eldest daughter, Ivanka, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, senior White House advisers.
From inviting her to the Group of 20 economic summit in Japan to including her in a small delegation that visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea, the president has repeatedly sought to promote Ivanka Trump on the world stage — often to the skepticism of observers, who have noted the first daughter’s lack of political or foreign policy credentials.
The president’s adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, have taken active roles in their father’s reelection campaign, appearing frequently at “Make America Great Again” rallies and denouncing Trump’s political opponents on social media.
