Mr. Ossoff, a former documentary filmmaker who nearly flipped a conservative House district in 2017, will run in one of two Senate races in the state next year.
Mr. Ossoff started his campaign with an endorsement from Representative John Lewis Monday night. “Like the many thousands Jon has already organized and inspired, I am ready to work tirelessly to elect him,” Mr. Lewis, the Georgia Democrat, said. “Georgia and America need Jon.”
Before taking charge of a documentary film company, Mr. Ossoff, 32 — if he won, he would be the youngest sitting member of the Senate by a large margin, behind 39-year-old Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri — spent five years working for Representative Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat.
Three other Democrats are already running for Mr. Perdue’s seat: Mayor Ted Terry of Clarkston; former Mayor Teresa Tomlinson of Columbus; and Sarah Riggs Amico, who ran for lieutenant governor last year on Ms. Abrams’s ticket. 
Democrats need to gain three seats to control the Senate if they win the White House in 2020, or four seats if Mr. Trump wins re-election, and they don’t have a lot of opportunities to do so. 
Only three Republican-held seats — in Arizona, Colorado and Maine — are rated as tossups by the Cook Political Report, which tracks congressional elections. To have any buffer at all, Democrats need to move more races to that column. And of all the other states with Republican-held Senate seats up for election, only North Carolina was closer in the presidential race than Georgia.
