The reason isn’t complex. Republicans love Trump and Democrats hate him, with independents on the Democratic side of the middle. In that YouGov poll, for example, Democrats give Trump an 11 percent approval, compared with 37 percent from independents and 87 percent from Republicans. Without partisans embracing or abandoning him, things don’t move a lot, which is why we call that YouGov poll result unremarkable.
There have been numerous other polls in recent weeks saying the same thing. Trump’s approval ranges from 38 percent to 44 percent; his approval among Republicans from 84 percent to 88 percent. Each of these polls looks essentially the same.
And yet here was what Trump had to offer on Monday morning.
94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!
Perhaps you noticed the horizontal dashed line on the graph above. It marks 94 percent, the point at which Republican support sits, according to Trump. You’ll notice that there’s some distance between that line and the tops of the red columns, suggesting that Trump’s estimation of his approval from Republicans doesn’t come from any of those polls.
So where does it come from? The short answer is: nowhere.
That’s not what’s happening here. Instead, Trump appears to simply be making the figure up. Perhaps there is internal polling showing Trump with substantially higher approval than public polls, a function of who they’re asking and how they’re asking it. But Trump doesn’t even say that; he just throws out this number as though it’s real.
Granted, an incumbent with 87 percent approval is formidable, as well, but Trump does have something of a penchant for exaggeration. In this case, though, that exaggeration seems as though it would run counter to his intent: A challenger thinking about getting into the race might accept Trump’s 94 percent figure as accurate, only to then discover it’s somewhat south of that.
Wait until they learn that his approval rating isn’t 50 percent, either.
