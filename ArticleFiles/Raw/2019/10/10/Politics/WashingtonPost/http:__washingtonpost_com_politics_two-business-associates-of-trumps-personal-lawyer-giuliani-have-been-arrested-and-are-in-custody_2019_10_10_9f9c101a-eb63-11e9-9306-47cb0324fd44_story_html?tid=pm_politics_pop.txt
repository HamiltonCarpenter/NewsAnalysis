Parnas and Fruman assisted Mr. Giuliani in connection with his representation of President Trump,” the letter said, while rejecting the House Intelligence Committee’s request for information about their transactions, calling the demands an overbroad effort to “harass, intimidate and embarrass my clients.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Shortly after the indictment was unsealed Thursday, House investigators issued subpoenas for Parnas and Fruman, seeking “key documents” and their eventual testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The 21-page indictment also alleges a separate scheme stretching from June 2018 to April of this year in which Parnas, Fruman and two other defendants, U.S. citizens David Correia and Andrey Kukushkin, conspired to make political donations secretly funded by an unidentified Russian businessman in the hopes of winning support for a marijuana business.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The plan, according to prosecutors, was to acquire retail marijuana licenses in Nevada and other states. In September 2018, Parnas, Fruman, Correia, Kukushkin and the Russian businessman met in Las Vegas to discuss the venture, the indictment charges. However, the group made efforts to hide the foreign national’s role because of what Kukushkin allegedly described as the businessman’s “Russian roots and current political paranoia about it<b>,</b>” the indictment alleges.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">To fund the effort, the Russian businessman allegedly gave the others $1 million, and the American partners set out to try to win political backing for their business plan. The four defendants “used those funds transferred by Foreign National-1, in part, to attempt to gain influence and the appearance of influence with politicians and candidates,” the indictment charges.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In October 2018, Parnas, Fruman and Kukushkin attended a campaign rally for an unidentified politician in Nevada, an event also attended by a different Nevada candidate for office, according to the indictment. They sent their Russian moneyman photographs of themselves posing with the second candidate, officials said. After the event, Fruman donated $10,000 to that second candidate, but authorities say it was actually the Russian’s money.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The planned marijuana business faltered, however, when the men did not apply in time for a recreational marijuana license, missing a September 2018 deadline. Kukushkin told the Russian that they were “2 months too late to the game unless we change the rules” and suggested a particular Nevada state official’s support was needed to take it further, according to the indictment.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Kukushkin was arrested in San Francisco, officials said, and a lawyer for him could not immediately be identified. Correia has not been arrested, but federal agents expect him to surrender soon, according to one official.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Parnas and Fruman are charged with falsification of records and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission; all four defendants are charged with conspiracy.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Parnas and Fruman have little history of political involvement but ascended rapidly into a circle of elite Trump donors after Parnas gave $50,000 to support Trump’s election in 2016.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In March 2018, Parnas and Fruman began scheming “to advance their personal financial interests and the political interests of at least one Ukrainian government official with whom they were working,” according to the indictment. To advance that scheme, they allegedly made a $325,000 contribution to an independent expenditure committee and a $15,000 donation to a second such committee.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy hide-for-print ma-0 mb-md interstitial italic"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-inquiry-puts-new-focus-on-giulianis-work-for-prominent-figures-in-ukraine/2019/10/01/b3c6d08c-e089-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_58">Impeachment inquiry puts new focus on Giuliani’s work for prominent figures in Ukraine</a></p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined"><b></b>Previous social media posts and interviews indicate the duo interacted with both Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr., and had attended events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida and at the White House. Fruman attended a fundraiser held at Mar-a-Lago in March 2018.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In a now-deleted Facebook post that was unearthed by BuzzFeed News and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Parnas displayed photos of himself and Trump at an event that apparently took place at the White House on May 1, 2018.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Later that month, Fruman gave an interview to a Brooklyn-based Russian-language publication, in which he said that he and Parnas had attended an eight-person meeting with Trump in Washington the previous week to discuss the upcoming midterm elections. At the meeting, Fruman said he handed the president a personal note from Ukraine’s top rabbi, which he said Trump read and then tucked in the breast pocket of his jacket.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">On May 21, 2018, Parnas posted a photo online of himself and Fruman with Trump Jr. and Tommy Hicks, a Republican fundraiser and close friend of the president’s son, at what he wrote was a breakfast in California.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The president on Thursday told reporters he didn’t know Parnas or Furman.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“I don’t know those gentlemen. . . . Now, it’s possible I have a picture with them, because I have a picture with everybody,” Trump said.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Parnas has told The Post that he decided to get involved politically because he was a passionate supporter of Trump’s candidacy after growing up in New York and selling Trump condos in the city when Trump’s late father, Fred Trump, was still running the Trump Organization.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In May 2018, about six months before the men began working with Giuliani on his Biden investigation, a Florida business established by Parnas received a $1.26 million wire transfer from an account whose owner was represented by a real estate lawyer who specializes in assisting foreign buyers of U.S. property, court documents and corporate filings show.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Two days later, the pro-Trump super PAC, America First, reported receiving $325,000 from Global Energy Producers, the newly-created company controlled by Parnas and Fruman.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Last year, the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center filed a still-pending complaint with the Federal Election Commission over the donation, alleging that it appeared to be a straw donation that masked the identity of the original contributor.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Parnas told the Miami Herald last month that the money for the super PAC donation was from proceeds from the sale of a Miami-area condominium.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The real estate lawyer involved in the transfer, Russell S. Jacobs, did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md italic">Rachel Weiner, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey, Tom Hamburger,
