She started as a tax reporter, cutting her teeth on oversight coverage when House Republicans investigated the IRS’s treatment of tea party groups. She later covered the GOP’s investigation of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, then the party’s subsequent probe of Hillary Clinton’s private email use. \n\nBade spent three years covering House Republicans and President Trump’s remaking of the party from her vantage point on Capitol Hill. Her stories have followed GOP infighting and frequently dish behind-the-scenes details about how policy decisions are made, illuminating the personalities and power struggles that affect the public.\n\nBade worked for two years at CQ-Roll Call before Politico. An Ohio-native, she graduated from the University of Dayton with degrees in political science and communication. Bade is a former classical ballet dancer who still enjoys taking class occasionally.
