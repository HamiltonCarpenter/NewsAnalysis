He also thought about his female employees and clients who would be sharing a single-sex restroom with Stephens. Finally, he considered the impact on his clients’ grieving process. In the end, Tom could not agree to Stephens’s plan to violate the dress code, so he offered Stephens a severance.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Harris Funeral Homes is represented by the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, which says Title VII was not violated.

No one argues that Congress in 1964 intended to protect LGBTQ individuals; homosexual conduct was illegal in the vast majority of the country. The solicitor general said that basic fact should decide the cases.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“In 1964, the ordinary public meaning of ‘sex’ was biological sex,” Francisco wrote. Congress is free to make clear that Title VII includes sexual orientation and transgender status, Francisco said, but it has repeatedly turned down attempts to change the law to do so.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The plaintiffs and their lawyers say that the statute’s text, not what Congress intended, should hold. That is something of a switch — usually it is conservatives making such a textualist argument — and the lawyers point to an unlikely ally: the late justice Antonin Scalia.</p></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns dn db-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_inline_bb_8"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In a 1998 ruling in a case called<i> Oncale v.

Kennedy, who had written the majority opinion in each of the gay rights movement’s victories at the court. Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who did not rule on major gay rights issues as a lower-court judge, is thought to be more conservative than his former boss Kennedy.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">During a discussion of the case at Georgetown University Law Center, Supreme Court practitioner Roman Martinez said interpreting the text of the issue has scrambled usual alignments in the lower courts, with a leading liberal judge saying the statute does not cover sexual orientation and a leading conservative judge going the other way on transgender status.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">It is possible the Supreme Court would rule differently on the two issues, and some observers think a prohibition on transgender status discrimination is closer to the statute’s wording, “because of sex.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Nicole Saharsky, another lawyer who frequently argues before the court, thought that was more of a theoretical possibility than a real one.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“The Supreme Court’s going to say that there’s <i>not </i>a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but there is on the basis of transgender status?” she asked. “That just doesn’t seem like something they would do.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The cases are <i>Bostock v.
