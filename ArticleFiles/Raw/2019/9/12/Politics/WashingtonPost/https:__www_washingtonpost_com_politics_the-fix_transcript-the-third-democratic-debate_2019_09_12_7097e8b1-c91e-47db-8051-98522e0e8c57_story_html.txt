Below is a transcript of the debate; we’ll update it throughout the night. </i></p> <p data-elm-loc="2">FORMER HUD SECRETARY JULIÁN CASTRO: Good evening, y bienvenidos a Texas. Welcome to Texas.</p> <p data-elm-loc="3">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="4">It's great to be here at TSU, home of the Tigers. You know, on January 20, 2021, at 12:01 p.m., we're going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate.</p> <p data-elm-loc="5">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="6">There will be life after Donald Trump. But the truth is that our problems didn't start just with Donald Trump, and we won't solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision: universal pre-K and universal health care, unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy, a tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living.</p> <p data-elm-loc="7">But first, we have to win. And that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. That's what Kennedy did, it's what Carter did, it's what Clinton did, it's what Barack Obama did, and it's what I can do in this race. Get back Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, and finally turn Texas blue and say goodbye to Donald Trump.</p> <p data-elm-loc="8">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="9">ABC ANCHOR GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar?</p> <p data-elm-loc="10">SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Good evening, Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here, the 10 of us, is much stronger than what divides us. And I think that’s true of our country, too.</p> <p data-elm-loc="11">Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think we've already got that in the White House.</p> <p data-elm-loc="12">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="13">Houston, we have a problem. This -- we have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead. I think we need something different.</p> <p data-elm-loc="14">I am someone that tells the truth. I don't make promises that I can't keep. I have people's back. And I believe that to win, you bring people with you and that is how you govern, as well.</p> <p data-elm-loc="15">So, you're going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great. But if you see that some of them seem a little off-track, I've got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, you've got a home with me, because I don't want to be the president for half of America. I want to be the president for all of America.</p> <p data-elm-loc="16">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="17">STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman Beto O'Rourke?</p> <p data-elm-loc="18">O’ROURKE: It’s an honor to be on this debate stage. It is wonderful to be back in Texas, in Houston, back here at TSU.</p> <p data-elm-loc="19">On August 3, in El Paso, Texas, two things became crystal clear for me, and I think produced a turning point for this country. The first is just how dangerous Donald Trump is, the cost and the consequence of his presidency.</p> <p data-elm-loc="20">A racism and violence that had long been a part of America was welcomed out into the open and directed to my hometown of El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed, dozens more grievously injured by a man carrying a weapon he should never have been able to buy in the first place, inspired to kill by our president.</p> <p data-elm-loc="21">The second is how insufficient our politics is to meet the threat that we have right now. The bitterness, the pettiness, the smallness of the moment, the incentives to attack one another and try to make differences without distinctions, mountains out of mole hills, we have to be bigger. We have to see clearly, we have to speak honestly, and we have to act decisively. That's what I want to do for you as president of the United States. Thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="22">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="23">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Cory Booker?</p> <p data-elm-loc="24">BOOKER: It was over 20 years ago that I was a law student and moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, to serve as a tenants rights lawyer to try to address the challenges in my community. And I was sobered by them -- the gun violence, the substandard housing.</p> <p data-elm-loc="25">But it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Ms. Virginia Jones, who challenged me. She said, boy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that's all there's ever going to be. But if you're stubborn and defiant and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change. She was a church woman that said, without vision, the people will perish.</p> <p data-elm-loc="26">Well, that's exactly what we did. We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people think -- thought was impossible.</p> <p data-elm-loc="27">That’s the story of America. At our best, we unify, we find common cause and common purpose. The differences among us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party, not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. That’s why I’m running for president, and that’s how I will lead this nation.</p> <p data-elm-loc="28">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="29">STEPHANOPOULOS: Entrepreneur Andrew Yang?</p> <p data-elm-loc="30">YANG: In America today, everything revolves around the almighty dollar -- our schools, our hospitals, our media, even our government. It’s why we don’t trust our institutions anymore. We have to get our country working for us again, instead of the other way around. We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy rather than inputs into a giant machine.</p> <p data-elm-loc="31">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="32">When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens? The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants and you hope it works out. It's time to trust ourselves more than our politicians.</p> <p data-elm-loc="33">That’s why I’m going to do something unprecedented tonight. My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now. If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to <a href="http://yang2020.com/" target="_blank">yang2020.com</a> and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that. This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people.</p> <p data-elm-loc="34">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="35">STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Pete Buttigieg?</p> <p data-elm-loc="36">BUTTIGIEG: It’s original, I’ll give you that.</p> <p data-elm-loc="37">The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges we've ever seen. As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know what's at stake in our national leadership.</p> <p data-elm-loc="38">We keep sending politicians to Washington asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us. Good politics is supposed to be not about the day-to-day fights of the politicians, but about the day-to-day lives of Americans.</p> <p data-elm-loc="39">We just marked the anniversary of 9/11. All day today, I've been thinking about September 12th, the way it felt when for a moment we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people. That's what presidential leadership can do. That's what the presidency is for. And that is why I'm asking for your vote.</p> <p data-elm-loc="40">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="41">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Kamala Harris?</p> <p data-elm-loc="42">HARRIS: Thank you. It’s great to be back at TSU.</p> <p data-elm-loc="43">So I plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night. But first, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching.</p> <p data-elm-loc="44">(LAUGHTER)</p> <p data-elm-loc="45">So, President Trump, you've spent the last two-and-a-half years full-time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we've gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you've not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.</p> <p data-elm-loc="46">But here's what you don't get: What you don't get you is that the American people are so much better than this. And we know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we're registered to vote. And I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America.</p> <p data-elm-loc="47">And now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.</p> <p data-elm-loc="48">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="49">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Bernie Sanders? Senator Sanders?</p> <p data-elm-loc="50">SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Let me be blunt and tell you what you don’t hear much about in Congress or in the media, and that is, it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country.</p> <p data-elm-loc="51">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="52">But we must do more. We must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. And as president, I am prepared to take them on.</p> <p data-elm-loc="53">Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has health care as a human right, not a privilege. And, yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel.</p> <p data-elm-loc="54">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="55">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Elizabeth Warren?</p> <p data-elm-loc="56">WARREN: So, I was born and raised in Oklahoma, but I'm sure glad to be in Texas tonight.</p> <p data-elm-loc="57">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="58">All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas. That was their ticket to the middle class. Me, I got my big opportunity about a half-mile down the road from here at the University of Houston, back when it cost $50 a semester.</p> <p data-elm-loc="59">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="60">For a price that I could pay for, on a part-time waitressing job, I got to finish my four-year degree and I became a special needs teacher. And after law school, my first big job was back here in Houston.</p> <p data-elm-loc="61">By then, I had two little kids, and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt Bee moved in and saved us all.</p> <p data-elm-loc="62">The paths to America's middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. Today, service-members are preyed upon by predatory lenders. Students are crushed by debt. And families cannot afford childcare.</p> <p data-elm-loc="63">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="64">I know what's broken. I know how to fix it. And I'm going to lead the fight to get it done.</p> <p data-elm-loc="65">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="66">STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice President Joe Biden.</p> <p data-elm-loc="67">JOE BIDEN (D), FORMER VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said, we're doing it because we refuse to postpone. Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer's, and other diseases which, if we invest in them, we can find cures.</p> <p data-elm-loc="68">I refuse to postpone giving single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change and leading the world in taking on climate change.</p> <p data-elm-loc="69">Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single solitary time when we've set our mind to something we've been unable to do it. We're walking around with our heads down like woe is me. We're the best-equipped nation in the world to take this on. It's no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There's enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.</p> <p data-elm-loc="70">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="71">STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates, thank you. Several of you said you are more united than divided, and that is certainly true. All of you agree on one big thing, the goal of defeating President Trump, driving the country in a new direction. But out on the campaign trail, you have outlined big differences over how far to go and how fast to go.</p> <p data-elm-loc="72">And, Vice President Biden, the differences between you and the senators on either side of you tonight strike at the heart of this primary debate. Both senators Warren and Sanders want to replace Obamacare with Medicare for All. You want to build on Obamacare, not scrap it. They propose spending far more than you to combat climate change and tackle student loan debt. And they would raise more in taxes than you to pay for their programs.</p> <p data-elm-loc="73">Are senators Warren and Sanders pushing too far beyond where Democrats want to go and where the country needs to go?</p> <p data-elm-loc="74">BIDEN: That will be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I think -- I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way we add to it, replace everything that has been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.</p> <p data-elm-loc="75">Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn't cost $30 trillion, $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. That's before -- exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear that tonight how that's happened.</p> <p data-elm-loc="76">Thus far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. And the senator has, in fact, come forward and said how he's going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. There's a lot of other things that need to be done.</p> <p data-elm-loc="77">I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at-risk schools that are Title I schools, from 15 to $45 billion a year. But I go down the line and these are things we're talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it's better.</p> <p data-elm-loc="78">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, let me take that to you, particularly on what Senator Biden was saying there about health care. He has actually praised Bernie Sanders for being candid about his health care plan, that Senator -- says that Sanders has been candid about the fact that middle class taxes are going to go up and most of private insurance is going to be eliminated. Will you make that same admission?</p> <p data-elm-loc="79">WARREN: So, let's be clear about health care. And let's actually start where vice president did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed health care in America and committed this country to health care for every human being.</p> <p data-elm-loc="80">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="81">And now the question is, how best can we improve on it? And I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by health care at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it, those at the very top, the richest individuals and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more. And middle class families are going to pay less. That's how this is going to work.</p> <p data-elm-loc="82">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="83">STEPHANOPOULOS: Direct question. You said middle class families are going to pay less. But will middle class taxes go up to pail for pay for the program? I know you believe that the deductibles and the premiums will go down. Will middle class taxes go up? Will private insurance be eliminated?</p> <p data-elm-loc="84">WARREN: Look, what families have to deal with is cost, total cost. That's what they have to deal with. And understand, families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, sorry, you can't see that specialist. Every time an insurance company says, sorry, that doctor is out of network, sorry, we are not covering that prescription.</p> <p data-elm-loc="85">Families are paying every time they don't get a prescription filled because they can't pay for it. They don't have a lump checked out because they can't afford the co-pay. What we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets, what's going to happen in their budgets.</p> <p data-elm-loc="86">And the answer is on Medicare for All, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals and costs are going to go up for giant corporations. But for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down and that's how it should work under Medicare for All in our health care system.</p> <p data-elm-loc="87">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="88">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, you were invoked by the vice president, also take on that question about taxes.</p> <p data-elm-loc="89">SANDERS: Well, Joe said that Medicare for All would cost over $30 trillion.</p> <p data-elm-loc="90">That's right, Joe.</p> <p data-elm-loc="91">Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for All is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so...</p> <p data-elm-loc="92">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="93">... intend to eliminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all co-payments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because we're going to stand up to the greed and corruption and price-fixing of the pharmaceutical industry.</p> <p data-elm-loc="94">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="95">We need -- we need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies.</p> <p data-elm-loc="96">And I'll tell you how absurd the system is tonight on ABC, the health care industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for All is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd.</p> <p data-elm-loc="97">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="98">STEPHANOPOULOS: Vice president Biden...</p> <p data-elm-loc="99">KLOBUCHAR: If I could respond, George.</p> <p data-elm-loc="100">STEPHANOPOULOS: You get a response and then we're going to broaden out the discussion.</p> <p data-elm-loc="101">BIDEN: OK, number one, my health care plan does significantly cut the costs of -- the largest out-of-pocket payment you'll pay is $1,000. You'll be able to get into a -- anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, et cetera.</p> <p data-elm-loc="102">But guess what? Of the 160 million people who like their health care now, they can keep it. If they don't like it, they can leave. Number one.</p> <p data-elm-loc="103">Number two, the fact of the matter is, we're in a situation where, if you notice, he hasn't answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Let's have a big idea. The tax of 2 percent that the senator is talking about, that raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you $28 billion short.</p> <p data-elm-loc="104">The senator said before, it's going to cost you in your pay -- there will be a deductible, in your paycheck. You're going to -- the middle class person, someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more. They're going to end up paying 4 percent more on their income tax. That's a reality. Now, it's not a bad idea if you like it. I don't like it.</p> <p data-elm-loc="105">STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, now I want everybody to keep to the time, but you did invoke both senators. I have to get responses from them...</p> <p data-elm-loc="106">BIDEN: Sure, no, that's good.</p> <p data-elm-loc="107">STEPHANOPOULOS: ... and then we will broaden it out.</p> <p data-elm-loc="108">Senator Warren, you go first.</p> <p data-elm-loc="109">WARREN: So, let's be clear, I've actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.</p> <p data-elm-loc="110">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="111">I've met people who like their doctors. I've met people who like their nurses. I've met people who like their pharmacists. I've met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care. And we just need to be clear about what Medicare for All is all about.</p> <p data-elm-loc="112">Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we're going to do this by saying, everyone is covered by Medicare for All, every health care provider is covered. And the only question here in terms of difference is where to send the bill?</p> <p data-elm-loc="113">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders.</p> <p data-elm-loc="114">SANDERS: Let us be clear, Joe, in the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians or any other major country on earth.</p> <p data-elm-loc="115">BIDEN: This is America.</p> <p data-elm-loc="116">SANDERS: Yes, but Americans don't want to pay twice as much as other countries. And they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for All proposal, when you don't pay out-of-pocket and you don't pay premiums, maybe you've run into people who love their premiums, I haven't.</p> <p data-elm-loc="117">What people want is cost-effective health care, Medicare for All will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill.</p> <p data-elm-loc="118">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Klobuchar, you said in your opening statement you don't -- you want to represent the people stuck in the middle of the extremes. Who represents the extreme on this stage?</p> <p data-elm-loc="119">KLOBUCHAR: I think you know that I don't agree with some of these proposals up here, George, so I'm talking about...</p> <p data-elm-loc="120">STEPHANOPOULOS: Which ones?</p> <p data-elm-loc="121">KLOBUCHAR: If I could -- if I could respond to some of the proposals from my friends. First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar-Sanders Amendment to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada.</p> <p data-elm-loc="122">We have worked to bring down the cost by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, that's a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figure that's a lot of seniors and they should be allowed to get a better price.</p> <p data-elm-loc="123">But when it comes to our health care and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctor's creed, which is, do no harm. And while Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. And on page eight -- on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. And that means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance.</p> <p data-elm-loc="124">That's in four years. I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea. And what I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning. And that is a public option. A non-profit choice that would bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea.</p> <p data-elm-loc="125">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="126">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warren, page eight of the bill, she says, 149 people will lose their health insurance.</p> <p data-elm-loc="127">WARREN: I'm sorry.</p> <p data-elm-loc="128">STEPHANOPOULOS: She said, page eight of the bill, 149 million people will lose their health insurance.</p> <p data-elm-loc="129">KLOBUCHAR: Current health insurance.</p> <p data-elm-loc="130">BIDEN: One hundred forty-nine million.</p> <p data-elm-loc="131">STEPHANOPOULOS: Million, excuse me.</p> <p data-elm-loc="132">WARREN: So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors won't have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They won't have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members won't have to get into these battles.</p> <p data-elm-loc="133">What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your health care coverage.</p> <p data-elm-loc="134">STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Buttigieg?</p> <p data-elm-loc="135">BUTTIGIEG: The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesn't trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not my way or the highway.</p> <p data-elm-loc="136">Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if we're right, as progressives, that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you?</p> <p data-elm-loc="137">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders, 45 seconds.</p> <p data-elm-loc="138">SANDERS: George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? Fifty million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs or they go unemployed or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for All is comprehensive health care. Covers all basic needs, including home health care.</p> <p data-elm-loc="139">It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So, if you want comprehensive health care, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is the way to go.</p> <p data-elm-loc="140">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="141">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Harris, you startled out co-sponsoring Senator Sanders's bill, you now say you're uncomfortable with it. Why?</p> <p data-elm-loc="142">HARRIS: I want to give credit first to Barack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadn't the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far.</p> <p data-elm-loc="143">I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You know, you brought us this far on Medicare for All. I support Medicare for All, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did.</p> <p data-elm-loc="144">Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them.</p> <p data-elm-loc="145">So, under my Medicare for all plan, people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that's what people want. And I agree, we shouldn't take choice from people.</p> <p data-elm-loc="146">But here's the thing. Everybody on this stage, I do believe, is well intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don't have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump.</p> <p data-elm-loc="147">So let's talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We all fought against it. And then the late, great John McCain, at that moment at about 2 o'clock in the morning, killed his attempt to take health care from millions of people in this country.</p> <p data-elm-loc="148">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="149">Fast forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump's Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump's administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have pre-existing conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans.</p> <p data-elm-loc="150">And frankly, I think this discussion has given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they're going to have health care and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let's focus on the end goal. If we don't get Donald Trump out of office, he's going to get rid of all of it.</p> <p data-elm-loc="151">BIDEN: George, 15 seconds? Fifteen seconds?</p> <p data-elm-loc="152">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="153">STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me get to Congressman O'Rourke and then bring you -- go ahead, Mr. Vice President.</p> <p data-elm-loc="154">BIDEN: Fifteen seconds. Look, everybody says we want an option. The option I'm proposing is Medicare for all -- Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your insurance -- from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You don't have -- no pre-existing condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered, period.</p> <p data-elm-loc="155">And if you notice, nobody's yet said how much it's going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings, the president thinks -- my friend from Vermont thinks that the employer's going to give you back if you negotiated as a union all these years, got a cut in wages because you got insurance. They're going to give back that money to the employee?</p> <p data-elm-loc="156">SANDERS: As a matter of fact, they will in our bill.</p> <p data-elm-loc="157">BIDEN: Well, let me tell you something. For a socialist, you've got -- for a socialist, you've got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do.</p> <p data-elm-loc="158">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Sanders?</p> <p data-elm-loc="159">SANDERS: OK, one minute, George?</p> <p data-elm-loc="160">STEPHANOPOULOS: Go ahead.</p> <p data-elm-loc="161">SANDERS: All right. Two points. You got to defend the fact that today not only do we have 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500,000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why they're going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease -- cancer or heart disease.</p> <p data-elm-loc="162">Under my legislation, people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer. And our program is the only one that does that.</p> <p data-elm-loc="163">BIDEN: I know a lot about cancer, let me tell you something. It's personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately.</p> <p data-elm-loc="164">And we're talking four, six, eight, ten years, depending on who you talk about, before we get to Medicare for all. Come on. I've been there. You've been there. You know what it's like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now.</p> <p data-elm-loc="165">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="166">STEPHANOPOULOS: Congressman O'Rourke?</p> <p data-elm-loc="167">O'ROURKE: Yeah. Thank you. Listen, I'm grateful that we all agree about the urgency of this challenge and the fact that Donald Trump is undermining the limited protections that we have right now.</p> <p data-elm-loc="168">But I also think we're being offered a false choice between those who propose an all-or-nothing gambit, forcing tens of millions off of insurance that they like, that works for them, to force them onto Medicare, and others who want to, as the vice president does, incrementally improve what we have, which will still leave many, maybe millions uninsured and uncared for.</p> <p data-elm-loc="169">In a state like Texas, where the largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system, we've got to do better. In my proposal, Medicare for America, says everyone who's uninsured will be enrolled in Medicare. Everyone who's insufficiently insured, cannot afford it, can move over to Medicare. And those, like members of unions who've fought for the health care plans that work for them and their families, are able to keep them. This is the best possible path forward.</p> <p data-elm-loc="170">BIDEN: You just described my plan.</p> <p data-elm-loc="171">STEPHANOPOULOS: This is -- health care is the top issue for everyone in the country. I want to make sure everyone gets one minute to respond. So, Secretary Castro, Andrew Yang, and then Senator Booker, you will get a minute.</p> <p data-elm-loc="172">CASTRO: Thank you. And, you know, I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this. And, of course, we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered.</p> <p data-elm-loc="173">Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit, you said that wasn’t true, when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that, and they said that was true.</p> <p data-elm-loc="174">You know, I grew up with a grandmother who had type 2 diabetes, and I watched her condition get worse and worse. But that whole time, she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available.</p> <p data-elm-loc="175">If they choose to hold on to strong, solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do. But the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in and I would not require them to opt in. They would automatically be enrolled. They wouldn't have a buy in.</p> <p data-elm-loc="176">That's a big difference, because Barack Obama's vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not.</p> <p data-elm-loc="177">BIDEN: They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.</p> <p data-elm-loc="178">CASTRO: You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.</p> <p data-elm-loc="179">BIDEN: Do not have to buy in if you can't afford it.</p> <p data-elm-loc="180">CASTRO: You said they would have to buy in.</p> <p data-elm-loc="181">BIDEN: Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualifies for Medicaid, she would automatically be enrolled.</p> <p data-elm-loc="182">CASTRO: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in. You're forgetting that.</p> <p data-elm-loc="183">BIDEN: I said anyone like your grandmother who has no money.</p> <p data-elm-loc="184">CASTRO: I mean, look, look, we need a health care system...</p> <p data-elm-loc="185">BIDEN: She -- you're automatically enrolled.</p> <p data-elm-loc="186">CASTRO: It automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job, for instance, his health care plan would not automatically enroll you. You would have to opt in. My health care plan would. That's a big difference. I'm fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama, and you're not.</p> <p data-elm-loc="187">BIDEN: That'll be a surprise to him.</p> <p data-elm-loc="188">STEPHANOPOULOS: Andrew Yang?</p> <p data-elm-loc="189">YANG: Come on, guys.</p> <p data-elm-loc="190">BUTTIGIEG: This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable.</p> <p data-elm-loc="191">KLOBUCHAR: Yeah.</p> <p data-elm-loc="192">BUTTIGIEG: This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that -- my plan, your plan. Look, we all have different visions for what is better...</p> <p data-elm-loc="193">CASTRO: Yeah, that's called the Democratic primary election, Pete. That's called an election.</p> <p data-elm-loc="194">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="195">That's an election. You know? This is what we're here for. It's an election.</p> <p data-elm-loc="196">KLOBUCHAR: Yes, but a house -- a house divided cannot stand. And that is not how we're going to win this.</p> <p data-elm-loc="197">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="198">YANG: Look, everyone, we know we're on the same team here. We know we're on the same team. We all have a better vision for health care than our current president.</p> <p data-elm-loc="199">And I believe we're talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has run a business, I know that our current health care system makes it harder to hire people, makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend their contractors. It's harder to change jobs. It's certainly harder to start a business.</p> <p data-elm-loc="200">The pitch we have to make to the American people is, we will get the health care weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people.</p> <p data-elm-loc="201">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="202">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Booker...</p> <p data-elm-loc="203">YANG: Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity, people are focused on our health in the health care system.</p> <p data-elm-loc="204">And the Cleveland Clinic, where they're paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe -- shocker -- they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people.</p> <p data-elm-loc="205">STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Booker, close out this discussion.</p> <p data-elm-loc="206">BOOKER: Thank you very much. Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us that are afraid because they are in crisis. They don't have health insurance. Their health insurance doesn't go far enough. They can't afford their prescription drugs.</p> <p data-elm-loc="207">Look, I'm clear in what I believe. I believe in Medicare for all. I believe it's the best way to rationalize the system. But dear God, I know every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage and comes at this with the best of intentions.</p> <p data-elm-loc="208">And I'll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. And as a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now. They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now.</p> <p data-elm-loc="209">And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.</p> <p data-elm-loc="210">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="211">And we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader, I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans. But every single day, I'll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today.</p> <p data-elm-loc="212">STEPHANOPOULOS: Candidates, thank you. Linsey Davis?</p> <p data-elm-loc="213">DAVIS: Thanks, George. Since we're here at an HBCU, I'd like to start with young black voters. Several recent polls indicate their number-one concern is racism. This campus, this state, and this nation are still raw from that racially motivated attack on Latinos in El Paso.</p> <p data-elm-loc="214">Now, we know that the racial divide started long before President Trump and President Obama, but each of you on this stage has said that President Trump has made that divide worse. Congressman O'Rourke, coming to you first, why are you the most qualified candidate to address this divide?</p> <p data-elm-loc="215">O'ROURKE: You know, I called this out in no uncertain terms on August 3rd and every day since then. And I was talking about it long before then, as well.</p> <p data-elm-loc="216">Racism in America is endemic. It is foundational. We can mark the creation of this country not at the Fourth of July, 1776, but August 20, 1619, when the first kidnapped African...</p> <p data-elm-loc="217">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="218">... was brought to this country against his will and in bondage and as a slave built the greatness and the success and the wealth that neither he nor his descendants would ever be able to fully participate in and enjoy.</p> <p data-elm-loc="219">We have to be able to answer this challenge. And it is found in our education system, where in Texas, a 5-year-old child in kindergarten is five times as likely to be disciplined or suspended or expelled based on the color of their skin.</p> <p data-elm-loc="220">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="221">In our health care system, where there's a maternal mortality crisis three times as deadly for women of color, or the fact that there's 10 times the wealth in white America than there is in black America.</p> <p data-elm-loc="222">I'm going to follow Sheila Jackson Lee's lead and sign into law a reparations bill that will allow us to address this at its foundation.</p> <p data-elm-loc="223">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="224">But we will also call out the fact that we have a white supremacist in the White House and he poses a mortal threat to people of color all across this country.</p> <p data-elm-loc="225">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="226">DAVIS: Secretary Castro, 45 seconds to respond.</p> <p data-elm-loc="227">CASTRO: Look, you know, I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. He's done a great job with that.</p> <p data-elm-loc="228">Look, a few weeks ago, a shooter drove 10 miles inspired by this -- 10 hours inspired by this president to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out.</p> <p data-elm-loc="229">I'm proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. I'm also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because we're not going to have any more Laquan McDonalds or Eric Garners or Michael Browns or Pamela Turners or Walter Scotts or Sandra Bland, here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that.</p> <p data-elm-loc="230">DAVIS: Senator Booker, you have said, quote, "The real question isn't who is or isn't a racist. It's who is going to do something about it." Senator, what do you plan to do about it?</p> <p data-elm-loc="231">BOOKER: Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trump's a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists. The question isn't who isn't a racist. It's who is and isn't doing something about racism.</p> <p data-elm-loc="232">And this is not just an issue that started yesterday. It's not just an issue that we hear a president that can't condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation from health care to the criminal justice system. And it's nice to go all the way back to slavery, but dear God, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased, we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today than all the slaves in 1850.</p> <p data-elm-loc="233">We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out, and having a plan to do something about it. If I am president of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes.</p> <p data-elm-loc="234">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="235">And we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans, from criminal justice reform to the disparities in health care to even one that we don't talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country.</p> <p data-elm-loc="236">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="237">DAVIS: Mayor Buttigieg, you've been struggling with issues around race in your own community. You've also said that anyone who votes to re-elect President Trump is, at best, looking the other way on racism. Does that sort of talk alienate voters and potentially deepen divisions in our country?</p> <p data-elm-loc="238">BUTTIGIEG: I believe what’s deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a chance to change all of that.</p> <p data-elm-loc="239">Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him, it will be with us. That's why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. It's -- it's not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harms compound. In the same way that a dollar saved compounds, so does a dollar stolen.</p> <p data-elm-loc="240">And we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts us in two different countries.</p> <p data-elm-loc="241">I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas, marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time, a Douglass plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that we’re not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions, entrepreneurship, raising to 25 percent...</p> <p data-elm-loc="242">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="243">... the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses, investing in HBCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs.</p> <p data-elm-loc="244">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="245">We can and must do that. But that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced auto worker. Because when I -- where I come from, a lot of times that displaced auto worker is a single black mother of three. We've got to say that...</p> <p data-elm-loc="246">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="247">... and bring people together.</p> <p data-elm-loc="248">DAVIS: Also a concern for people of color is criminal justice reform.</p> <p data-elm-loc="249">Senator Harris, you released your plan for that just this week. And it does contradict some of your prior positions. Among them, you used to oppose the legalization of marijuana; now you don't. You used to oppose outside investigations of police shootings; now you don't. You've said that you changed on these and other things because you were, quote, "swimming against the current, and thankfully the currents have changed."</p> <p data-elm-loc="250">But when you had the power, why didn’t you try to effect change then?</p> <p data-elm-loc="251">(APPLAUSE) </p> <p data-elm-loc="252">HARRIS: So, there have been -- there have been -- I'm glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record.</p> <p data-elm-loc="253">Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons. One, I've always wanted to protect people and keep them safe. And second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias. And I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that, if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside.</p> <p data-elm-loc="254">And so I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who were arrested for drugs and getting them jobs.</p> <p data-elm-loc="255">I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.</p> <p data-elm-loc="256">I created one of the first in the nation trainings for a police officer on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system.</p> <p data-elm-loc="257">Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not. But my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one.</p> <p data-elm-loc="258">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="259">It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable.</p> <p data-elm-loc="260">And finally, my plan is about making sure that, in America's criminal justice system, we de-incarcerate women and children, that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact.</p> <p data-elm-loc="261">And as president of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete.</p> <p data-elm-loc="262">DAVIS: Thank you, Senator Harris.</p> <p data-elm-loc="263">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="264">Senator Klobuchar, during your eight years as a prosecutor in Minnesota, there were dozens of incidents where black men were killed by police. Critics say that too often you sided with police in these cases.</p> <p data-elm-loc="265">The ACLU's legal director in Minnesota has said that you showed no interest in racial justice. Do you wish now that you had done more?</p> <p data-elm-loc="266">KLOBUCHAR: That's not my record.</p> <p data-elm-loc="267">(UNKNOWN): (inaudible)</p> <p data-elm-loc="268">KLOBUCHAR: We are here at a historically black college. And I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something that she once said. She said, "What the people want is simple; they want a country as good as its promise."</p> <p data-elm-loc="269">And that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand to make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis.</p> <p data-elm-loc="270">But in the prosecutor's office, they were handled with a grand jury. That's how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself.</p> <p data-elm-loc="271">That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids.</p> <p data-elm-loc="272">There was a kid named Byron Phillips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it. When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups; we put up billboards; we found the shooter and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Tyesha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window.</p> <p data-elm-loc="273">What changes did we make? Go after white-collar crimes in a big way, diversity the office in a big way, work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID.</p> <p data-elm-loc="274">And as a senator and as your president, I will make sure that we don't just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90 percent of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, let's reduce those sentences for nonviolent offenders and let's get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison.</p> <p data-elm-loc="275">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="276">DAVIS: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.</p> <p data-elm-loc="277">You all believe that the war on drugs has put too many Americans behind bars.</p> <p data-elm-loc="278">Vice President Biden, you have a plan to release many nonviolent drug offenders from prison. Senator Booker says that your plan is not ambitious enough. Your response?</p> <p data-elm-loc="279">BIDEN: Well, first of all, let me say that, when I came back from law school, I had a job with a great -- a big-time law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege when Dr. King was assassinated. We were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months.</p> <p data-elm-loc="280">I've been involved from the beginning. As a young congressman -- as a young councilman, I introduced legislation to try to keep them from putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining; banks should have to lend where they operate, et cetera.</p> <p data-elm-loc="281">The fact of the matter is that what's happened is that we're in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn't be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation.</p> <p data-elm-loc="282">Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. As -- when we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons.</p> <p data-elm-loc="283">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="284">We -- I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them that when they get out -- nobody who got in prison for marijuana, for example, immediately upon being released -- they shouldn't be in there; that should be a misdemeanor. They should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned.</p> <p data-elm-loc="285">When you finish your term in prison, you should be able not only to vote but have access to Pell grants, have access to be able to get housing...</p> <p data-elm-loc="286">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="287">... have access to be able to move along the way. I've laid out a detailed plan along those lines. And the fact is, we've learned so much more more...</p> <p data-elm-loc="288">DAVIS: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p> <p data-elm-loc="289">BIDEN: Thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="290">DAVIS: Senator Booker, 45 seconds to respond.</p> <p data-elm-loc="291">BOOKER: Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. There's no difference in America between blacks, whites and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs. But if you are African-American, you are almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives.</p> <p data-elm-loc="292">And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Brian Stephenson says treats you better if you’re rich and guilty than if you’re poor and innocent.</p> <p data-elm-loc="293">And so I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstrably now show that there are 17,000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say, when we are president of the United States; when I am president of the United States, we will release them.</p> <p data-elm-loc="294">And let me be specific. I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president, for criminal justice reform, that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail.</p> <p data-elm-loc="295">If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long, and we changed it, but we didn't make it retroactive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now.</p> <p data-elm-loc="296">Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people. And I challenge you. Don't just say a big statement; back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long.</p> <p data-elm-loc="297">DAVIS: Thank you, Senator Booker.</p> <p data-elm-loc="298">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="299">David?</p> <p data-elm-loc="300">MUIR: Thank you, Linsey.</p> <p data-elm-loc="301">I want to turn to the deadly mass shootings here in this country. And of course we are all mindful tonight of where we stand. We are here in Texas tonight, where 29 people have lost their lives in just the last month alone, El Paso, which we've discussed; in Odessa. And I know there are survivors from El Paso right here in the hall tonight.</p> <p data-elm-loc="302">Vice President Biden, I do want to direct this to you, because we all remember Sandy Hook. Twenty-six people died in that school, 20 of them children. Those first graders would be in eighth grade today.</p> <p data-elm-loc="303">MUIR: At the time, there was a groundswell in this country to get something done. President Obama asked you to lead the push for gun control.</p> <p data-elm-loc="304">You have often pointed to your ability to reach across the aisle to get things done, but four months after Sandy Hook, a measure to require expanded background checks died on the Senate floor.</p> <p data-elm-loc="305">If you couldn't get it done after Sandy Hook, why should voters give you another chance?</p> <p data-elm-loc="306">BIDEN: Because I got it done before. I'm the only one up here that's ever beat the NRA --only one ever to beat the NRA nationally. I'm the guy that brought the Brady bill into -- into focus and became law.</p> <p data-elm-loc="307">And so that's number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook, a number of things happened. It went from a cause to a movement. Look what's happened now. Mothers -- the organization -- mothers against violence -- gun violence. We've seen what's happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change.</p> <p data-elm-loc="308">There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50 percent of gun -- of gun -- of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I've been saying and we've all been saying is correct.</p> <p data-elm-loc="309">Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street -- period. And we have to get buy-backs and get them out of their basements.</p> <p data-elm-loc="310">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="311">So the point is, things have changed. And things have changed a lot. And now what's happening is -- and, by the way, the way Beto handled -- excuse me for saying Beto. What the congressman...</p> <p data-elm-loc="312">O'ROURKE: That's all right. Beto's good.</p> <p data-elm-loc="313">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="314">BIDEN: The way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful, to look in the eyes of those people, to see those kids...</p> <p data-elm-loc="315">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="316">... to understand those parents, you understand the heartache.</p> <p data-elm-loc="317">(UNKNOWN): But this is the problem.</p> <p data-elm-loc="318">BIDEN: We are ready to do this.</p> <p data-elm-loc="319">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="320">MUIR: Mr. Vice President...</p> <p data-elm-loc="321">(UNKNOWN): This is the problem.</p> <p data-elm-loc="322">O'ROURKE: Thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="323">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="324">MUIR: ... you did bring up assault weapons here.</p> <p data-elm-loc="325">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="326">You did bring up assault weapons here, and many of you on this stage have talked about executive order.</p> <p data-elm-loc="327">Senator Harris, you have said that you would take executive action on guns within your first 100 days...</p> <p data-elm-loc="328">HARRIS: Correct.</p> <p data-elm-loc="329">MUIR: ... including banning imports of AR-15 assault weapons.</p> <p data-elm-loc="330">HARRIS: That's right.</p> <p data-elm-loc="331">MUIR: President Obama, after Sandy Hook, more than 23 executive actions, and yet here we all are today.</p> <p data-elm-loc="332">In recent days former Vice President Biden has said about executive orders, "Some really talented people are seeking the nomination. They said 'I'm going to issue an executive order.'" Biden saying, "There's no constitutional authority to issue that executive order when they say 'I'm going to eliminate assault weapons,'" saying, "you can't do it by executive order any more than Trump can do things when he says he can do it by executive order."</p> <p data-elm-loc="333">Does the vice president have a point there?</p> <p data-elm-loc="334">BIDEN: Some things you can. Many things you can't.</p> <p data-elm-loc="335">MUIR: Let's let the senator answer.</p> <p data-elm-loc="336">HARRIS: Well, I mean, I would just say, hey, Joe, instead of saying, no, we can't, let's say yes, we can.</p> <p data-elm-loc="337">(LAUGHTER)</p> <p data-elm-loc="338">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="339">BIDEN: Let's be constitutional. We've got a Constitution.</p> <p data-elm-loc="340">HARRIS: And yes, we can, because I'll tell you something. The way that I think about this is, I've seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="341">And the idea that we would wait for this Congress, which has just done nothing, to act, is just -- it is overlooking the fact that every day in America, our babies are going to school to have drills, elementary, middle and high school students, where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school.</p> <p data-elm-loc="342">I was talking about this at one of my town halls, and -- and this child who was eight years old, probably, came up to me -- it was like it was a secret between the two of us, and he tugged on my jacket and he said, "I had to have one of those drills."</p> <p data-elm-loc="343">It is traumatizing our children. El Paso -- and, Beto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. You know, people asked me...</p> <p data-elm-loc="344">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="345">... in El Paso -- they said, you know, because I have a long-standing record on this issue. They said, "Well, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?"</p> <p data-elm-loc="346">And I said, "Well, look, I mean, obviously, he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweeting out the ammunition."</p> <p data-elm-loc="347">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="348">MUIR: Senator Harris, thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="349">Vice President Biden, do you still stand by what you said on an executive order?</p> <p data-elm-loc="350">BIDEN: No, what I said was -- the question -- speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say, "By the way, you can't own the following weapons, period; they cannot be sold anymore" -- check with constitutional scholars. Now, you can say...</p> <p data-elm-loc="351">MUIR: Mr. Vice President, thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="352">Congressman O'Rourke, I want to get to you on this.</p> <p data-elm-loc="353">(CROSSTALK)</p> <p data-elm-loc="354">HARRIS: John, could I tell you what you could do in 100 days?</p> <p data-elm-loc="355">MUIR: I'm going to -- I'm going to work down the row here. But I do want to come to Congressman O'Rourke, because I know this is personal to you. El Paso is your hometown. Some on this stage have suggested a voluntary buy-back for guns in this country.</p> <p data-elm-loc="356">You've gone further. You've said, quote, "Americans who own AR-15s and AK-47s will have to sell them to the government, all of them." You know that critics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns? And how would this work?</p> <p data-elm-loc="357">O'ROURKE: I am, if it's a weapon that was designed to kill people on a battlefield...</p> <p data-elm-loc="358">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="359">If the high impact, high velocity round, when it hits your body, shreds everything inside of your body, because it was designed to do that, so that you would bleed to death on a battlefield and not be able to get up and kill one of our soldiers.</p> <p data-elm-loc="360">When we see that being used against children, and in Odessa, I met the mother of a 15-year-old girl who was shot by an AR-15, and that mother watched her bleed to death over the course of an hour because so many other people were shot by that AR-15 in Odessa and Midland, there weren't enough ambulances to get to them in time, hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.</p> <p data-elm-loc="361">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="362">We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.</p> <p data-elm-loc="363">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="364">MUIR: Congressman, thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="365">O'ROURKE: And I want to say this. I'm listening to the people of this country. The day after I proposed doing that, I went to a gun show in Conway, Arkansas, to meet with those who were selling AR-15s and AK-47s and those who were buying those weapons. And you might be surprised, there was some common ground there, folks who said, I would willingly give that up, cut it to pieces, I don't need this weapon to hunt, to defend myself. It is a weapon of war.</p> <p data-elm-loc="366">So, let's do the right thing, but let's bring everyone in America into the conversation, Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, and non-gun owners alike.</p> <p data-elm-loc="367">(UNKNOWN): May I make a point?</p> <p data-elm-loc="368">MUIR: Congressman, thank you. I want to bring in Senator Klobuchar on this, because you've often talked about your uncle and the proud hunters back home in Minnesota. So I wanted to get your response to Congressman O'Rourke tonight. Where do you stand on mandatory gun buybacks?</p> <p data-elm-loc="369">KLOBUCHAR: I so appreciate what the congressman's been doing. And I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us.</p> <p data-elm-loc="370">Everyone up here favors an assault weapon ban. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which, by the way, would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store, where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage. And certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds, one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute, and it still wasn't enough to save those people. That's what unites us.</p> <p data-elm-loc="371">You know what else unites us? And I'll tell you this. What unites us is that right now, on Mitch McConnell's desk, are three bills -- universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole, and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers don't get AK-47s.</p> <p data-elm-loc="372">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="373">MUIR: Senator Klobuchar?</p> <p data-elm-loc="374">KLOBUCHAR: So if we want to get something done -- and I personally think we should start with a voluntary buyback program. That's what I think, David. But I want to finish this, because if you want action now, if you want action now, we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We can't wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done.</p> <p data-elm-loc="375">MUIR: Senator Klobuchar...</p> <p data-elm-loc="376">KLOBUCHAR: Because we cannot spare another innocent life.</p> <p data-elm-loc="377">MUIR: Thank you. Thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="378">I want to turn to Senator Booker, because you have said just this week about guns and about the candidates on this stage, that the differences do matter. Those were your words.</p> <p data-elm-loc="379">You have argued, if you need a license to drive a car in this country, you should have a license to buy a gun. Gun-owners would not only have to pass a background check, they would have to obtain a federal license to buy a gun. This would require, as you know, Congress to pass legislation.</p> <p data-elm-loc="380">If Democrats can't get universal background checks, how would you get this done? And can you name one Republican colleague of yours in the Senate right now who would be onboard with this idea?</p> <p data-elm-loc="381">BOOKER: So, background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans. Eighty-three percent of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue.</p> <p data-elm-loc="382">Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. It's one of the reasons why shooting after shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. It's why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And I'm happy that people like Beto O'Rourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing.</p> <p data-elm-loc="383">But this is what I'm sorry about. I'm sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.</p> <p data-elm-loc="384">You want to know how we get this done? We get this done by having a more courageous empathy, where people don't wait for this hell to visit upon their communities. They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.</p> <p data-elm-loc="385">I will lead change on this issue, because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine, because we forget, national shootings, these mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before.</p> <p data-elm-loc="386">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="387">MUIR: Senator Booker, thank you. A quick follow-up, though, because Americans watching tonight know the reality of Congress in Washington. I asked do you have a Republican colleague in the Senate who would be onboard with this idea to get this done?</p> <p data-elm-loc="388">BOOKER: You know, if that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights, if it was this idea that we can't get it done because of the situation in the Senate, I'm looking to lead a movement. The number-one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry.</p> <p data-elm-loc="389">Think about this. We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined, from the Revolutionary War until now. This is not a side issue to me. It is a central issue to me.</p> <p data-elm-loc="390">That is the kind of fight -- because the majority of homicide victims -- we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine. We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country so that we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency. Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun-owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue, and I will lead it.</p> <p data-elm-loc="391">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="392">BIDEN: Go beat them.</p> <p data-elm-loc="393">MUIR: Senator Booker, thank you. Senator Warren, I want to come to you next, because you have actually said in recent days that there are things you can get done with Republicans in the Senate. What can you get done on gun control?</p> <p data-elm-loc="394">WARREN: So let’s start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country.</p> <p data-elm-loc="395">And we agree on many steps we could take to fix it. My view on this is, we're going to -- it's not going to be one and done on this. We're going to do it, and we're going to have to do it again, and we're going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly.</p> <p data-elm-loc="396">But here's the deal. The question we need to ask is, when we've got this much support across the country, 90 percent of Americans want to see us do -- I like registration -- want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets, why doesn't it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple.</p> <p data-elm-loc="397">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="398">We have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry. And unless we're willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we're not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let's do background checks, let's get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.</p> <p data-elm-loc="399">Until we attack the systemic problems, we can't get gun reform in this country. We've got to go straight against the industry and we've got to change Congress, so it doesn't just work for the wealthy and well-connected, so it works for the people.</p> <p data-elm-loc="400">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="401">MUIR: Senator Warren, thank you. You bring up eliminating the filibuster, which means you would need simply a simple majority in a Republican Senate to get something done. I want to turn to Senator Sanders on this, because you've said before of this, if Donald Trump supports ending the filibuster, which he's talked about himself, you should be nervous. Would you support ending the filibuster?</p> <p data-elm-loc="402">SANDERS: No. But what I would support, absolutely, is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about, Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen, and you can do it in a variety of ways. You can do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is in order and what is not.</p> <p data-elm-loc="403">But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that, in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Cory and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system, and that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining what's happening in Washington or, in this case, you've got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership.</p> <p data-elm-loc="404">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="405">I am proud -- I am proud that, year after year, I had an "F" rating from the NRA. And as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA.</p> <p data-elm-loc="406">MUIR: Senator Sanders, thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="407">HARRIS: May I respond...</p> <p data-elm-loc="408">RAMOS: We've been hearing a lot about what's been happening here in Texas. Only a few weeks ago, the deadliest massacre of Latinos, Latinos, in modern U.S. history happened in this state, in El Paso. So the fear among Latinos -- and you know this -- is very real.</p> <p data-elm-loc="409">So let me start with an issue that is causing a lot of division in this country: immigration. Vice President Biden, as a presidential candidate, in 2008, you supported the border wall, saying, "Unlike most Democrats, I voted for 700 miles of fence." This is what you said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="410">Then you served as vice president in an administration that deported 3 million people, the most ever in U.S. history. Did you do anything to prevent those deportations? I mean, you've been asked this question before and refused to answer, so let me try once again. Are you prepared to say tonight that you and President Obama made a mistake about deportations? Why should Latinos trust you?</p> <p data-elm-loc="411">BIDEN: What Latinos should look at is -- comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous, number one. We didn't lock people up in cages. We didn't separate families. We didn't do all of those things, number one.</p> <p data-elm-loc="412">Number two -- number two, by the time -- this is a president who came along with the DACA program. No one had ever done that before. This is the president that sent legislation to the desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is a president who's done a great deal. So I'm proud to have served with him.</p> <p data-elm-loc="413">What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed. I would, in fact, make sure that there is -- we immediately surge to the border. All those people who are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard. That's who we are. We're a nation who says, if you want to flee, and you're freeing oppression, you should come.</p> <p data-elm-loc="414">I would change the order that the president just changed, saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.</p> <p data-elm-loc="415">And by the way, retrospectively, you know, the 25th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Let's put pressure on them to pass the Violence Against Women Act. Now (inaudible) back...</p> <p data-elm-loc="416">RAMOS: Yeah, but you didn't answer the question.</p> <p data-elm-loc="417">BIDEN: Well, I did answer the question.</p> <p data-elm-loc="418">RAMOS: No, did you make a mistake with those deportations?</p> <p data-elm-loc="419">BIDEN: The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.</p> <p data-elm-loc="420">RAMOS: How about you?</p> <p data-elm-loc="421">BIDEN: I'm the vice president of the United States.</p> <p data-elm-loc="422">RAMOS: Secretary Castro, would you want to respond to Vice President Biden?</p> <p data-elm-loc="423">CASTRO: I mean, look...</p> <p data-elm-loc="424">RAMOS: And let me put this in context, because your party controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and didn't pass immigration reform, and this broke a promise made by President Barack Obama to Latinos. So why should voters trust Democrats now? I mean, now it is even more difficult, as you know, because you need Republican votes in the Senate. So are you willing, for instance, to give up DACA or give up a path to citizenship or even agree to build a wall in order to legalize 10.5 million undocumented immigrants?</p> <p data-elm-loc="425">CASTRO: Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And, look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fearmongering and otherizing migrants, and that's very different from Barack Obama.</p> <p data-elm-loc="426">But my problem with Vice President Biden -- and Cory pointed this out last time -- is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that's me, too, and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, well, that was the president. I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions. I mean...</p> <p data-elm-loc="427">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="428">RAMOS: Vice President Biden, you have -- you have 45 seconds.</p> <p data-elm-loc="429">CASTRO: Let me just say...</p> <p data-elm-loc="430">BIDEN: That's not what I said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="431">CASTRO: Let me just say...</p> <p data-elm-loc="432">BIDEN: That's not what I said.</p> <p data-elm-loc="433">CASTRO: Jorge, let me just say that I would -- I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because I'm not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. I'm not going to back pedal. I'm not going to pretend like I don't have my own vision for immigration.</p> <p data-elm-loc="434">So we're not going to give up DACA. We're not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20, 2021, we're going to have a Democratic president, we're going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House, and we're going to pass immigration reform within the first 100 days.</p> <p data-elm-loc="435">RAMOS: Vice President, 45 seconds.</p> <p data-elm-loc="436">BIDEN: I did not say I don't -- I stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent. That's where I stand. I did not say I did not stand with him.</p> <p data-elm-loc="437">RAMOS: OK, Senator Warren, hundreds of children have been separated from their parents at the border. And recently, in Mississippi, we saw the largest immigration raid in a decade.</p> <p data-elm-loc="438">You want ICE, the agency in charge of rounding up undocumented immigrants.</p> <p data-elm-loc="439">So how would you deal with the millions of immigrants who arrive legally but overstay their visas? And how would you stop hundreds of thousands of Central Americans who want to migrate to the U.S.?</p> <p data-elm-loc="440">WARREN: Well, I start with a statement of principles, and that is, in this country, immigration does not make us weaker, immigration makes us stronger.</p> <p data-elm-loc="441">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="442">I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our DREAMers, but also for their grandparents, and for their cousins, for people who have overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable.</p> <p data-elm-loc="443">Down at the border, we've got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal, and a 12-year-old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer, and it is not serving our values.</p> <p data-elm-loc="444">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="445">RAMOS: Mr. Yang...</p> <p data-elm-loc="446">WARREN: We need -- I want to add one more part on this, because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering.</p> <p data-elm-loc="447">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="448">We need to restore that help. We need to help establish and re-establish the rule of law so that people don't feel like they have to flee for their lives. We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically. We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back.</p> <p data-elm-loc="449">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="450">RAMOS: Mr. Yang? It is true that in the last few years we have seen the most severe anti-immigrant measures, from putting kids in cages to limiting asylum for people fleeing gangs and domestic violence. But it is also true about 1 million immigrants enter the U.S. legally every year. So, are you willing to raise the number of legal immigrants from 1 million to 2 million per year? And should there be a merit system, as President Trump wants?</p> <p data-elm-loc="451">WARREN: So, yes -- oh, I'm sorry. Did you me or...</p> <p data-elm-loc="452">YANG: It was me.</p> <p data-elm-loc="453">WARREN: Oh, he said it. OK. Sorry.</p> <p data-elm-loc="454">YANG: My -- my father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor and now his son is running for president. That is the immigration story that we have...</p> <p data-elm-loc="455">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="456">... to be able to share with the American people.</p> <p data-elm-loc="457">If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants. And rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for our economic and social dynamism, and I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama-Biden administration.</p> <p data-elm-loc="458">I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says, build a wall. I'm going to say to immigrants, come to America, because if you come here, your son our daughter can run for president. The water is great. And this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.</p> <p data-elm-loc="459">This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations. If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success. And that is where I would lead as president.</p> <p data-elm-loc="460">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="461">RAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH)</p> <p data-elm-loc="462">BUTTIGIEG: Gracias.</p> <p data-elm-loc="463">RAMOS: (INAUDIBLE) Pete, eight out of 10 Latinos in Texas for another mass shooter targeting them. This is according to a new Univision poll. President Trump has called Mexican immigrants rapists and killers, tried to ban Muslims from entering the country separated children from their parents.</p> <p data-elm-loc="464">He supporters have chanted, build a wall and send her back. Do you think that people who support President Trump and his immigration policies are racist?</p> <p data-elm-loc="465">BUTTIGIEG: Anyone who supports this is supporting racism.</p> <p data-elm-loc="466">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="467">(SPEAKING SPANISH)</p> <p data-elm-loc="468">The only people, though, who actually buy into this president's hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don't know any. We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went into ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out, because they never thought it would happen to him.</p> <p data-elm-loc="469">In some of the most conservative, rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow. And that's why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city.</p> <p data-elm-loc="470">You know, the only reason that South Bend is growing right now, after years of shrinking, is immigration. It's one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington, to create city-issued municipal IDs, so that people, regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification.</p> <p data-elm-loc="471">We have an opportunity to actually get something done. But we cannot allow this continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values. Values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws.</p> <p data-elm-loc="472">RAMOS: (SPEAKING SPANISH)</p> <p data-elm-loc="473">In an interview eight months ago, you were asked to asked what to do with the so-called "over-stayers," people who come with a visa and then stay. And you said, I don't know. Do you have an answer now?</p> <p data-elm-loc="474">O'ROURKE: I do. And if you read the rest of that article in The Washington Post, I talked about harmonizing our entry/exit system with Mexico in the same way that we do with Canada. I think that could help us to keep a handle on visa over-stays.</p> <p data-elm-loc="475">But I think the larger question that we're trying to get at is, how do we rewrite this country's immigration laws in our own image? In the image of Houston, Texas, the most diverse city in the United States of America.</p> <p data-elm-loc="476">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="477">In the image of El Paso, Texas, one of the safest cities in the United States of America. Safe, not despite the fact that we are a city of immigrants, safe because we are a city of immigrants.</p> <p data-elm-loc="478">(SPEAKING SPANISH)</p> <p data-elm-loc="479">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="480">I will lead an effort to make sure that we rewrite our immigration laws in that way. Never cage another child. Make sure that there is accountability and justice for the seven lives lost under our care and our custody, but also face the fact that Democrats and Republicans alike voted to build a wall that has produced thousands of deaths of people trying to cross to join family or to work a job.</p> <p data-elm-loc="481">That we have been part of deporting people, hundreds of thousands just in the Obama administration alone, who posed no threat to this country, breaking up their families. Democrats have to get off the back foot, we have to lead on this issue, because we know it is right.</p> <p data-elm-loc="482">Legalize America, begin with those more than 1 million DREAMers, make them U.S. citizens right now in this, their true home country...</p> <p data-elm-loc="483">(APPLAUSE)</p> <p data-elm-loc="484">... and extend that to their parents, their sisters and their brothers, and ensure that we have a legal, safe, orderly system to come to this country and add to our greatness here.</p> <p data-elm-loc="485">RAMOS: Thank you. George.</p> <p data-elm-loc="486">STEPHANOPOULOS: Jorge, thank you.</p> <p data-elm-loc="487">We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, national security, foreign policy, homeland security, the impact on American jobs and U.S. troops.</p> <p data-elm-loc="488">(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p> <p data-elm-loc="489">ANNOUNCER: Live from Texas Southern University in Houston, the "Democratic Debate."</p> <p data-elm-loc="490">STEPHANOPOULOS: Welcome back. We want to turn now to national security and the foreign policy issue that has such a direct impact here at home. The U.S. relationship with China, trade, and President Trump's tariffs. We received more than 100 questions from viewers wanting to know how all of you are going to handle these tariffs.</p> <p data-elm-loc="491">And, Mr. Yang, let me begin with you. Would you repeal the tariffs on your first day in office? And if so, would you risk losing leverage in our trade relationship with China?</p> <p data-elm-loc="492">YANG: I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal, because right now, the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China.</p> <p data-elm-loc="493">A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated U.S. intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said, one, how can my workers compete against that? And, two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.</p> <p data-elm-loc="494">So, the imbalances are real. But we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that President Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides.</p> <p data-elm-loc="495">So, no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers.</p> <p data-elm-loc="496">STEPHANOPOULOS: Mayor Pete, let me take that question -- let me take that question to you, because you've seen President Trump's tweets. He says what's going to happen here is the Chinese are just going to wait him out so that they can get a Democrat who they can take advantage of.</p> <p data-elm-loc="497">How do you think about China? We've seen President Trump call President Xi both an enemy and a friend.</p> <p data-elm-loc="498">BUTTIGIEG: Well, the president clearly has no strategy.</p> </article> <div class="clear"></div>
