Kee is now, grudgingly, okay with the Democrats pressing toward impeachment.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“This feels different to me,” said Kee, 73. “Back when he said to Putin, ‘Russia, if you’re listening, go after Hillary,’ I thought, ‘Okay, that’s just his ego talking.’ But what he did to this Ukrainian guy, now he’s using his position for his own interests.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Kee still doesn’t like the idea of Congress removing Trump — a decision she thinks voters should make on their own — but she believes House Democrats are making a principled decision, even if she’s certain it won’t succeed.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“It will help the Democrats because they finally did something about him,” she said. “But I fear it will help Trump, too, because he’s always making himself out to be the victim, and that always works for him.”</p></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns dn db-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_inline_bb_5"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns db dn-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_mob_bigbox_5"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Impeachment — Congress’s power to remove a president without a vote by the people — has never been popular. In the 1970s with Republican Richard Nixon and in the 1990s with Democrat Bill Clinton, a majority of Americans concluded that the president had behaved badly. But the country remained largely opposed to impeachment until shortly before Nixon resigned, and in Clinton’s case, all the way through his acquittal by the Senate.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In Washington, the Ukraine story sucked the air out of every other issue. In Iowa and other early primary states, Democratic presidential candidates watched as news coverage pivoted from the campaign to impeachment. Political consultants and pundits shifted into hyper-speculation mode, urgently searching for clues about how the impeachment probe might alter the country’s political path.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In swing districts, the Ukraine call and impeachment inquiry didn’t seem quite the watershed events they were in the capital, but some voters welcomed the move.</p></div><div><div></div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In the Yorba Linda, Calif., townhouse development where Frank Bryant lives, some neighbors no longer speak to each other because of their opposing views on Trump. “It’s way too personal,” so nobody talks politics anymore around the community pool, said Bryant, a professor of marketing at nearby Cal Poly Pomona.</p></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns dn db-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_inline_bb_6"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns db dn-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_mob_bigbox_6"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">He generally votes for Democrats, but he admires how Trump has managed the economy. Now, Bryant’s ready to go along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to switch gears and embrace impeachment.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“I think we have to go with the speaker right now,” Bryant said. “She’s been very careful, and so, if she sees something there now, I believe her.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Voters on both sides echoed Pelosi’s concerns earlier this year that an impeachment drive could hurt Democrats. Trump supporters and opponents alike predicted that the move might strengthen Trump’s reelection bid.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The modern history of impeachment demonstrates that a sitting president can indeed turn the tables on his accusers, said Frank O. Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri School of Law and author of “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/high-crimes-and-misdemeanors/06FDD57E104F3891A4C2B50175195FA5">High Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>,” a history of impeachment. Bowman said that Clinton effectively pressed his case in the news media, portraying his Republican opponents as bad guys who wanted to use his extramarital sexual affair to remove him from office.</p></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns dn db-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_inline_bb_7"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><div class="cb bg-offwhite mt-xxs pad-top-md pad-bottom-md mb-lg ml-neg-gutter mr-neg-gutter mr-auto-ns ml-auto-ns db dn-ns relative" style="min-height:250px"><div class="absolute z-0" style="left:50%;top:50%">AD</div><div class="relative z-1"><div class=""><wp-ad class="hide-for-print hide-for-print" id="slug_mob_bigbox_7"></wp-ad></div></div></div></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“Clinton managed to flip the public narrative from his own bad behavior to the behavior of those who attacked him,” the historian said. “Trump doesn’t need Clinton to teach him anything about fighting dirty. Any attempt to impeach Trump is going to invite the nastiest kinds of backlash, first of all against Joe Biden.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In St. Clair Shores, a sharply split district in Detroit’s northern suburbs, Diana Rascano, 69, said she often votes for Democrats in local elections, where government “touches your life more than the feds.” But in presidential votes, she’s a consistent Republican because of her conservative views on abortion, immigration and taxes.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The transcript of the president’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart sounded like standard business talk to her, not unlike what she recalls from her days as an executive at the Detroit Edison utility company.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Rascano said Democrats, some Republicans and the news media are acting as “one big angry mob in . . . a constant barrage of trying to find a crime” committed by Trump. As a result, she said, she’s more supportive of the president in 2020 than she was in 2016.</p></div><div><div></div></div><div><h3 class="font--subhead color-gray-darkest ma-0">Switching sides</h3></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In northwestern Pennsylvania, Trump in 2016 became the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Erie County in more than three decades.

Casey Jr. both carried the county by about 20 points.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In Harborcreek, a working-class town just east of Erie city, many residents said they weren’t paying much attention to the unfolding impeachment controversy in Washington.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Jim Cass, a 77-year-old retired bar owner who has been a Republican all his life, has never liked Trump and said the Ukraine matter has only validated his view.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“I think he is a liar and a cheat and I never trusted him with our foreign affairs,” Cass said, “and I don’t like anything about him. Period.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">He’s all for impeaching the president, but he isn’t sure Congress will be able to amass sufficient evidence to get the job done, and he worries that the debate will deepen the nation’s divisions.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">He’s certain the debate will exacerbate divisions within his own family. He has a son and a son-in-law “who loves Trump,” but another son and a daughter-in-law who “don’t have any use for him, either.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">But Cass said the risk of more family fights is worth it if the result is removing from office the man he considers “mentally ill.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">To another Republican in Harborcreek, though, the move toward impeachment seems a recipe for a Trump victory in 2020. Randy Wienke, a 64-year-old truck driver, has been stuck in the house for several days recovering from back surgery — plenty of time to absorb details of the Ukraine story on Fox News.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">He’s concluded that Democrats are just out to remove Trump over a phone call that he said most voters don’t care about. “They just don’t like him, and they don’t like him because he doesn’t play into their little clique politics game there,” Wienke said.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">He’s convinced that the “real criminals” are Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who have been the target of Trump’s counterattack this week.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Even if Trump did do something wrong, Wienke said, he doesn’t understand why Democrats would rush to push him from office: “Who would take his place? Mike Pence? They still would not be getting rid of any of his conservative, Republican political views.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The impeachment initiative has changed some minds — if not about Trump, then about the Democrats lining up against him.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Tom Shaw, 56, a fraud investigator in Henrico, Va., voted for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and then Trump in the last election, in good part because he liked the idea of a businessperson managing the country.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“Business is tough and running this country is like a big business,” Shaw said. He’s been pleased to see Trump cut red tape, lower unemployment, reduce corporate tax rates and sign a criminal justice reform bill.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">But Shaw switched gears last year to vote against his Republican congressman, Dave Brat, and choose Democrat Abigail Spanberger because she’d served as a CIA officer and promised to work with Republicans.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">He won’t vote for her again, though, because of her strong advocacy for gun control — and because she announced her support for impeachment this week.</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“I’d love to see her sit down and lay out the specific facts that are illegal involving Trump,” he said. “But we’ll see. Maybe something comes out in the hearings. If there’s evidence that Trump violated some law or did something unethical, I would vote to impeach him in a second.”</p></div><div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Portnoy reported from Chesterfield, Va.; Wilson from Yorba Linda, Calif.; Craig from Erie, Pa.; and Fisher from Washington.

He has been the enterprise editor, local columnist and Berlin bureau chief, among other positions, over 30 years at the paper. Fisher wrote several Post articles that won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2016 and the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2014.\n\nFisher previously wrote The Post’s local column and a blog, “Raw Fisher.” Earlier, he was the paper’s special reports editor, wrote about politics and culture for the Style section, served as Central Europe bureau chief on The Post’s Foreign staff, and covered D.C. schools and D.C. politics for the Metro section, where he was also an assistant city editor.\n\nHis history of radio since the advent of television, “Something in the Air: Radio, Rock and The Revolution That Shaped a Generation” (Random House, 2007), traces radio’s role in the nation’s popular culture from 1950 to the present, focusing on how old media adapt when new technologies burst onto the marketplace. While writing that book, he was a visiting scholar at George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs. He was also Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton University.\n\nFisher is the author of “After the Wall: Germany, the Germans and the Burdens of History” (Simon and Schuster, 1995). The book is a reporter’s view of Germany after reunification, focusing on the country’s struggle with its history during a century of trauma and aggression.
